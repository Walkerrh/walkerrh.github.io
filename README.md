Github pages builds websites with jekyll. jekyll runs on ruby. jekyll and ruby are hard to run on windows. to build this site, and without being linked to a fork, do the following: fork the template -> clone -> delete fork -> make new repo with cloned files -> now it builds 

^of course nobody can do that to this repo as the licensing and terms of service
