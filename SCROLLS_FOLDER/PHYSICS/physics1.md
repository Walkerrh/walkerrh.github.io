# College Physics 1 Notes

## Kinematics
### Description
The study of motion without considering its causes. Includes concepts like displacement, velocity, and acceleration.
### Formula
Displacement:
$$ \Delta x = x_f - x_i $$

Velocity:
$$ v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} $$

Acceleration:
$$ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} $$

Kinematic equations (constant acceleration):
$$ v_f = v_i + at $$
$$ x_f = x_i + v_i t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 $$
$$ v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a(x_f - x_i) $$

## Newton's Laws of Motion
### Description
Fundamental laws describing the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it.
### Formula
First Law (Inertia):
An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by a net external force.

Second Law (F = ma):
$$ F = ma $$

Third Law (Action-Reaction):
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

## Work and Energy
### Description
Work is the energy transferred to or from an object via the application of force along a displacement. Energy is the capacity to do work.
### Formula
Work:
$$ W = Fd \cos(\theta) $$

Kinetic Energy:
$$ KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$

Potential Energy:
$$ PE = mgh $$

Work-Energy Theorem:
$$ W = \Delta KE $$

## Conservation of Energy
### Description
The total energy of an isolated system remains constant. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed.
### Formula
Total Mechanical Energy:
$$ E = KE + PE $$

Conservation of Mechanical Energy:
$$ KE_i + PE_i = KE_f + PE_f $$

## Momentum and Collisions
### Description
Momentum is the product of an object's mass and velocity. Collisions can be elastic or inelastic.
### Formula
Momentum:
$$ p = mv $$

Impulse:
$$ J = \Delta p = F\Delta t $$

Conservation of Momentum:
$$ p_i = p_f $$

Elastic Collision:
Both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.

Inelastic Collision:
Momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is not.

## Rotational Motion
### Description
The study of objects that rotate about an axis. Includes angular displacement, angular velocity, and angular acceleration.
### Formula
Angular Displacement:
$$ \theta = \frac{s}{r} $$

Angular Velocity:
$$ \omega = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t} $$

Angular Acceleration:
$$ \alpha = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t} $$

Rotational Kinematic Equations (constant angular acceleration):
$$ \omega_f = \omega_i + \alpha t $$
$$ \theta_f = \theta_i + \omega_i t + \frac{1}{2}\alpha t^2 $$
$$ \omega_f^2 = \omega_i^2 + 2\alpha(\theta_f - \theta_i) $$

## Rotational Dynamics
### Description
The study of the effect of forces on the rotational motion of objects. Includes torque and moment of inertia.
### Formula
