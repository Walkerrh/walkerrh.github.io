# College Physics 2 Notes

## Electric Charge and Electric Field
### Description
The study of electric charges and the electric fields they produce.
### Formula
Coulomb's Law:
$$ F = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} $$

Electric Field:
$$ E = \frac{F}{q} = k_e \frac{q}{r^2} $$

Electric Field of a Point Charge:
$$ E = k_e \frac{q}{r^2} $$

## Gauss's Law
### Description
Gauss's Law relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed by that surface.
### Formula
$$ \Phi_E = \oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0} $$

## Electric Potential and Capacitance
### Description
Electric potential is the work done to move a charge from infinity to a point in space. Capacitance is the ability of a system to store charge.
### Formula
Electric Potential:
$$ V = \frac{U}{q} $$

Potential Difference:
$$ \Delta V = V_b - V_a = -\int_a^b \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{r} $$

Capacitance:
$$ C = \frac{Q}{V} $$

Capacitance of a Parallel Plate Capacitor:
$$ C = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d} $$

## Current, Resistance, and Electromotive Force
### Description
Current is the flow of electric charge. Resistance is the opposition to the flow of current. Electromotive force (emf) is the energy provided by a source per unit charge.
### Formula
Current:
$$ I = \frac{Q}{t} $$

Ohm's Law:
$$ V = IR $$

Resistivity:
$$ R = \rho \frac{L}{A} $$

Electromotive Force:
$$ \mathcal{E} = \frac{dW}{dq} $$

## Direct Current Circuits
### Description
Circuits in which the current flows in one direction.
### Formula
Series Resistors:
$$ R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots $$

Parallel Resistors:
$$ \frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \ldots $$

Kirchhoff's Rules:
- Junction Rule: $$ \sum I_{in} = \sum I_{out} $$
- Loop Rule: $$ \sum V = 0 $$

## Magnetic Fields and Magnetic Forces
### Description
The study of magnetic fields and the forces they exert on moving charges and currents.

$$ B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r} $$

## Sources of Magnetic Field
### Description
The study of how magnetic fields are produced by moving charges and currents.

### Description
The process of generating an electromotive force (emf) by changing the magnetic flux through a circuit.
### Formula
Faraday's Law of Induction:
$$ \mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} $$

Lenz's Law:
The direction of the induced emf opposes the change in magnetic flux.

## Inductance
### Description
Inductance is the property of a circuit that opposes changes in current.
