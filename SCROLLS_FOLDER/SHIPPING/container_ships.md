### Definitions

#### General Information

**Date Launched**:  
The specific month and year when the vessel was first launched into the water for the initial time.

**Length**:  
The total length of the vessel from the foremost point of the bow to the aftermost point of the stern.

**Beam**:  
The width of the vessel at its widest point, typically measured at the midpoint of the vessel's length.

**Draft**:  
The vertical distance between the waterline and the bottom of the hull (keel), indicating how deep the vessel sits in the water.

#### Specifications

**Class**:  
The classification of the vessel, assigned by a recognized classification society or maritime authority, indicating the standards the vessel adheres to for safety, construction, and operational purposes. In this context, "JG" refers to the Japan Government's standards for coastal vessels.

**Gross Tonnage**:  
A measure of the overall internal volume of a vessel, used to determine regulatory requirements, such as safety rules and port fees. It is calculated based on the molded volume of all enclosed spaces of the ship.

**DWT (Deadweight Tonnage)**:  
The total weight a vessel can safely carry, including cargo, fuel, fresh water, ballast water, provisions, passengers, and crew. It is the difference between the displacement of the ship in water and the weight of the ship itself.

#### Dimensions

**LOA (Length Overall)**:  
The maximum length of the vessel from the tip of the bow to the farthest point of the stern, providing a comprehensive measure of the vessel's total length.

**Beam**:  
The width of the vessel at its widest point, a critical measurement for determining the vessel's stability and cargo-carrying capacity.

**Draft**:  
The vertical distance between the waterline and the bottom of the hull (keel), indicating how deep the vessel sits in the water. This term is repeated for emphasis as it is a crucial dimension for navigation and docking.

#### Machinery

**Main Engine**:  
The primary engine that powers the vessel's propulsion system, providing the necessary thrust to move the vessel through the water. The engine's specifications include its model, power output (in horsepower or kilowatts), and operating speed (RPM).

**Auxiliary Engine**:  
Additional engines on the vessel that provide power for non-propulsion functions, such as electrical generation, powering auxiliary machinery, and other onboard systems. These engines also have specifications for model, power output, and operating speed.
