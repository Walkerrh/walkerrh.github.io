chemical properties: flammability, corrosiveness, reacivity with acids
chemical change(reaction): 
physical change: phase change same particles
chemical change: different particles before and after

physical properties
chemical properteis

density
melting point
boiling point

macroscopic-scale: properties and behavior we can see
atomic-scale: properties and behavior we can not see

we study observable changes in matter to understand their unobservable causes

Energy: the ability to do work
all work involves movement
the object doing the work transfer some of the energy it possess to the object on which the work is done
total energy: potential energy + kinetic energy
potential energy: relative object position 
kinetic energy: object motion
