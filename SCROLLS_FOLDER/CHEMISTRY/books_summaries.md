- Chemists study the composition and properties of matter and how they change.
- Matter exists in three physical states—solid, liquid, and gas. The behavior of each state is due to the arrangement of the particles.
- Each substance has a unique set of physical properties (attributes of the substance itself) and chemical properties (attributes of the substance as it interacts with or changes to other substances). Changes in matter can be physical (different form of the same substance) or chemical (different substance).
- A physical change caused by heating may be reversed by cooling. But a chemical change caused by heating can be reversed only by other chemical changes.
- Macroscopic changes result from submicroscopic changes.
- Changes in matter are accompanied by changes in energy.
- An object’s potential energy is due to its position; an object’s kinetic energy is due to its motion. Energy used to lift a weight, stretch a spring, or separate opposite charges increases the system’s potential energy, which is converted to kinetic energy as the system returns to its original condition. Energy changes form but is conserved.
- Chemical potential energy arises from the positions and interactions of a substance’s particles. When a higher energy (less stable) substance is converted into a more stable (lower energy) substance, some potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.

### Summary of Section 1.2
- The scientific method is a process designed to explain and predict phenomena.
- Observations lead to hypotheses about how a phenomenon occurs. When repeated with no exceptions, observations may be expressed as a natural law.
- Hypotheses are tested by controlled experiments and revised when necessary.
- If reproducible data support a hypothesis, a model (theory) can be developed to explain the observed phenomenon. A good model predicts related phenomena but must be refined whenever conflicting data appear.

### Summary of Section 1.3
- The SI unit system consists of seven base units and numerous derived units.
- Exponential notation and prefixes based on powers of 10 are used to express very small and very large numbers.
- The SI base unit of length is the meter (m); on the atomic scale, the nanometer (nm) and picometer (pm) are used commonly.
- Volume (V) units are derived from length units, and the most important volume units are the cubic meter (m³) and the liter (L).
- The mass of an object—the quantity of matter in it—is constant. The SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). The weight of an object varies with the gravitational field.
- A measured quantity consists of a number and a unit.
- A conversion factor is a ratio of equivalent quantities (and, thus, equal to 1) that is used to express a quantity in different units.
- The problem-solving approach used in this book has four parts: (1) plan the steps to the solution, which often includes a flow diagram (road map) of the steps, (2) perform the calculations according to the plan, (3) check to see if the answer makes sense, and (4) practice with similar, follow-up problems and compare your solutions with the ones at the end of the chapter.
- Density (d), a characteristic physical property of a substance, is the ratio of the mass of a sample to its volume.
- Temperature (T) is a measure of the relative hotness of an object. Heat is energy that flows from an object at higher T to one at lower T.
- Temperature scales differ in the size of the degree unit and/or the zero point. For scientific uses, temperature is measured in kelvins (K) or degrees Celsius (°C).
- Extensive properties, such as mass, volume, and energy, depend on the amount of a substance. Intensive properties, such as density and temperature, do not.

### Summary of Section 1.4
- The final digit of a measurement is always estimated. Thus, all measurements have some uncertainty, which is expressed by the number of significant figures.
- The certainty of a calculated result depends on the certainty of the data, so the answer has as many significant figures as in the least certain measurement.
- Excess digits are rounded off in the final answer according to a set of rules.
- The choice of laboratory device depends on the certainty needed.
- Exact numbers have as many significant figures as the calculation requires.
- Precision refers to how close values are to each other, and accuracy refers to how close values are to the actual value.
- Systematic errors give values that are either all higher or all lower than the actual value. Random errors give some values that are higher and some that are lower than the actual value.
- Precise measurements have low random error; accurate measurements have low systematic error and low random error.
- A systematic error is often caused by faulty equipment and can be compensated for by calibration.

### Summary of Section 2.1
- All matter exists as either elements, compounds, or mixtures.
- Every element or compound is a substance, matter with a fixed composition.
- An element consists of only one type of atom and occurs as a collection of individual atoms or molecules; a molecule consists of two or more atoms chemically bonded together.
- A compound contains two or more elements chemically combined and exhibits different properties from its component elements. The elements occur in fixed parts by mass because each unit of the compound has a fixed number of each type of atom. Only a chemical change can break down a compound into its elements.
- A mixture consists of two or more substances mixed together, not chemically combined. The components exhibit their individual properties, can be present in any proportion, and can be separated by physical changes.

### Summary of Section 2.2
- The law of mass conservation states that the total mass remains constant during a chemical reaction.
- The law of definite composition states that any sample of a given compound has the same elements present in the same parts by mass.
- The law of multiple proportions states that, in different compounds of the same elements, the masses of one element that combine with a fixed mass of the other can be expressed as a ratio of small whole numbers.

### Summary of Section 2.3
- Dalton’s atomic theory explained the mass laws by proposing that all matter consists of indivisible, unchangeable atoms of fixed, unique mass.
- Mass is conserved during a reaction because the atoms retain their identities but are combined differently.
- Each compound has a fixed mass fraction of each of its elements because it is composed of a fixed number of each type of atom.
- Different compounds of the same elements exhibit multiple proportions because they each consist of whole atoms.

### Summary of Section 2.4
- Several major discoveries at the turn of the 20th century resolved questions about Dalton’s model and led to our current model of atomic structure.
- Cathode rays were shown to consist of negative particles (electrons) that exist in all matter. J. J. Thomson measured their mass/charge ratio and concluded that they are much smaller and lighter than atoms.
- Robert Millikan determined the charge of the electron, which he combined with other data to calculate its mass.
- Ernest Rutherford proposed that atoms consist of a tiny, massive, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons.

### Summary of Section 2.5
- An atom has a central nucleus, which contains positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons and is surrounded by negatively charged electrons. An atom is neutral because the number of electrons equals the number of protons.
- An atom is represented by the notation $$ \ce{^{A}_{Z}X} $$, in which Z is the atomic number (number of protons), A the mass number (sum of protons and neutrons), and X the atomic symbol.
- An element occurs naturally as a mixture of isotopes, atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Each isotope has a mass relative to the $$ \ce{^{12}C} $$ mass standard.
- The atomic mass of an element is the average of its isotopic masses weighted according to their natural abundances. It is determined using a mass spectrometer.

### Summary of Section 2.6
- In the periodic table, the elements are arranged by atomic number into horizontal periods and vertical groups.
- Nonmetals appear in the upper-right portion of the table, metalloids lie along a staircase line, and metals fill the rest of the table.
- Elements within a group have similar behavior, whereas elements within a period have dissimilar behavior.

### Summary of Section 2.7
- Although a few elements occur uncombined in nature, the great majority exist in compounds.
- Ionic compounds form when a metal transfers electrons to a nonmetal, and the resulting positive and negative ions attract each other to form a three-dimensional array. In many cases, metal atoms lose and nonmetal atoms gain enough electrons to attain the same number of electrons as in atoms of the nearest noble gas.
- Covalent compounds form when elements, usually nonmetals, share electrons. Each covalent bond is an electron pair mutually attracted by two atomic nuclei.
- Monatomic ions are derived from single atoms. Polyatomic ions consist of two or more covalently bonded atoms that have a net positive or negative charge due to a deficit or an excess of electrons.

### Summary of Section 2.8
- An ionic compound is named with cation first and anion second: metal name nonmetal root + -ide. For metals that can form more than one ion, the charge is shown with a roman numeral: metal name(charge) nonmetal root + -ide.
- Oxoanions have suffixes, and sometimes prefixes, attached to the root of the element name to indicate the number of oxygen atoms.
- Names of hydrates have a numerical prefix indicating the number of associated water molecules.
- Acid names are based on anion names.
- For binary covalent compounds, the first word of the name is the element farther left or lower down

### Summary of Section 3.1
- A mole of substance is the amount that contains Avogadro’s number (6.022×10²³) of chemical entities (atoms, ions, molecules, or formula units).
- The mass (in grams) of a mole of a given entity (atom, ion, molecule, or formula unit) has the same numerical value as the mass (in amu) of the entity. Thus, the mole allows us to count entities by weighing them.
- Using the molar mass (ℳ, g/mol) of an element (or compound) and Avogadro’s number as conversion factors, we can convert between amount (mol), mass (g), and number of entities.
- The mass fraction of element X in a compound is used to find the mass of X in a given amount of the compound.

### Summary of Section 3.2
- From the masses of elements in a compound, their relative numbers of moles are found, which gives the empirical formula.
- If the molar mass of the compound is known, the molecular formula, the actual numbers of moles of each element, can also be determined, because the molecular formula is a whole-number multiple of the empirical formula.
- Combustion analysis provides data on the masses of carbon and hydrogen in an organic compound, which are used to obtain the formula.
- Atoms can bond in different arrangements (structural formulas). Two or more compounds with the same molecular formula are constitutional isomers.

### Summary of Section 3.3
- A chemical equation has reactant formulas on the left of a yield arrow and product formulas on the right.
- A balanced equation has the same number of each type of atom on both sides.
- Balancing coefficients are integer multipliers for all the atoms in a formula and apply to the individual entities or to moles of entities.

### Summary of Section 3.4
- The substances in a balanced equation are related to each other by stoichiometrically equivalent molar ratios, which are used as conversion factors to find the amount (mol) of one substance given the amount of another.
- In limiting-reactant problems, the quantities of two (or more) reactants are given, and the limiting reactant is the one that forms the lower quantity of product. Reaction tables show the initial and final quantities of all reactants and products, as well as the changes in those quantities.
- In practice, side reactions, incomplete reactions, and physical losses result in an actual yield of product that is less than the theoretical yield (the quantity based on the molar ratio from the balanced equation), giving a percent yield less than 100%. In multistep reaction sequences, the overall yield is found by multiplying the yields for each step.
- Atom economy, or the proportion of reactant atoms found in the product, is one criterion for choosing a “greener” reaction process.

### Summary of Section 4.1
- Because of polar bonds and a bent shape, the water molecule is polar, and water dissolves many ionic and covalent compounds.
- When an ionic compound dissolves, the attraction between each ion and water molecules replaces the attraction between ions. Soluble ionic compounds are electrolytes because the ions are free to move and, thus, the solution conducts electricity.
- The formula of a soluble ionic compound shows the number of moles of each ion in solution per mole of compound dissolved.
- Water dissolves many covalent substances that contain polar bonds. These compounds are nonelectrolytes because the molecules remain intact and, thus, the solution does not conduct electricity.
- The concentration of a solute in a solution can be expressed by molarity, which is the number of moles of solute dissolved in 1 liter of solution. A more concentrated solution (higher molarity) is converted to a more dilute solution (lower molarity) by adding solvent.
- Molarity can be used as a conversion factor between volume of solution and amount (mol) of solute, from which you can find mass of solute.

### Summary of Section 4.2
- In a precipitation reaction, an insoluble ionic compound forms when solutions of two soluble ones are mixed. The electrostatic attraction between certain pairs of solvated ions is strong enough to overcome the attraction of each ion for water molecules.
- Based on a set of solubility rules, we can predict the formation of a precipitate by noting which of all possible cation-anion combinations is insoluble.
- A molecular equation shows all substances as intact and undissociated into ions.
- A total ionic equation shows all soluble ionic compounds as separate, solvated ions. Spectator ions appear unchanged on both sides of the equation.
- A net ionic equation eliminates the spectator ions and, thus, shows only the actual chemical change.
- When chemical changes such as precipitation reactions occur in solution, amounts of reactants and products are given in terms of concentration and volume.
- By using molarity as a conversion factor, we can apply the principles of stoichiometry to precipitation reactions in solution.

### Summary of Section 4.3
- In an acid-base (neutralization) reaction between an acid (an H⁺-yielding substance) and a base (an OH⁻-yielding substance), H⁺ and OH⁻ ions form H₂O.
- Strong acids and bases dissociate completely in water (strong electrolytes); weak acids and bases dissociate slightly (weak electrolytes).
- An acid-base reaction involves the transfer of a proton from an acid (a species that donates H⁺) to a base (a species that accepts H⁺).
- Since weak acids dissociate very little, an ionic equation shows a weak acid as an intact molecule transferring its proton to the base.
- A gas-forming acid-base reaction occurs when an acid transfers a proton to a carbonate (or sulfite), forming water and a gas that leaves the reaction mixture.
- Molarity can be used as a conversion factor to solve stoichiometric problems involving acid-base reactions.
- In a titration, the known concentration of one solution is used to determine the concentration of the other.

### Summary of Section 4.4
- When one reactant has a greater attraction for electrons than another, there is a net movement of electrons, and a redox reaction takes place. Electron gain (reduction) and electron loss (oxidation) occur simultaneously.
- Assigning oxidation numbers to all atoms in a reaction is a method for identifying a redox reaction. The species that is oxidized (contains an atom that increases in oxidation number) is the reducing agent; the species that is reduced (contains an atom that decreases in oxidation number) is the oxidizing agent.
- A redox titration determines the concentration of an oxidizing agent from the known concentration of the reducing agent (or vice versa).

### Summary of Section 4.5
- A reaction that has an element as reactant or product is a redox reaction.
- In combination redox reactions, elements combine to form a compound, or a compound and an element combine.
- In decomposition redox reactions, a compound breaks down by absorption of heat or electricity into elements or into a different compound and an element.
- In displacement redox reactions, one element displaces the ion of another from solution.
- Activity series rank elements in order of ability to displace each other. A more reactive metal can displace (reduce) hydrogen ion or the ion of a less reactive metal from solution. A more reactive halogen can displace (oxidize) the ion of a less reactive halogen from solution.
- Combustion releases heat through a redox reaction of a substance with $$ \ce{O2} $$.

### Summary of Section 4.6
- Every reaction is reversible if all the substances involved are present.
- As the amounts of products increase, the reactants begin to re-form. When the reverse reaction occurs as rapidly as the forward reaction, the amounts of the substances no longer change, and the reaction mixture has reached dynamic equilibrium.
- Weak acids and bases reach equilibrium in water with a very small proportion of their molecules dissociated.
- An aqueous ionic reaction “goes to completion” because a product is removed (as a gas) or because a product (usually water or a precipitate) is formed that reacts very slightly in a reverse reaction.

### Summary of Section 5.1
- The volume of a gas can be altered significantly by changing the applied force or the temperature. Corresponding changes for liquids and solids are much smaller.
- Gases flow more freely and have much lower densities than liquids and solids.
- Gases mix in any proportions to form solutions; liquids and solids generally do not.
- Differences in the physical states are due to the greater average distance between particles in a gas than in a liquid or a solid.

### Summary of Section 5.2
- Gases exert pressure (force/area) on all surfaces they contact.
- A barometer measures atmospheric pressure based on the height of a mercury column that the atmosphere can support (760 mmHg at sea level and 0°C).
- Closed-end and open-end manometers are used to measure the pressure of a gas sample.
- Pressure units include the atmosphere (atm), torr (identical to mmHg), and pascal (Pa, the SI unit).

### Summary of Section 5.3
- Four interdependent variables define the physical behavior of an ideal gas: volume (V), pressure (P), temperature (T), and amount (number of moles, n).
- Most simple gases display nearly ideal behavior at ordinary temperatures and pressures.
- Boyle’s, Charles’s, and Avogadro’s laws refer to the linear relationships between the volume of a gas and the pressure, temperature, and amount of the gas, respectively.
- At STP (0°C and 1 atm), 1 mol of an ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.
- The ideal gas law incorporates the individual gas laws into one equation: $$ PV = nRT $$, where R is the universal gas constant.

### Summary of Section 5.4
- Gas density is inversely related to temperature and directly related to pressure: higher T and lower P causes lower d, and vice versa. At the same P and T, gases with larger values of $$ \mathcal{M} $$ have higher values of d.
- In a mixture of gases, each component contributes its partial pressure to the total pressure (Dalton’s law of partial pressures). The mole fraction of each component is the ratio of its partial pressure to the total pressure.
- When a gaseous reaction product is collected by bubbling it through water, the total pressure is the sum of the gas pressure and the vapor pressure of water at the given temperature.
- By converting the variables P, V, and T for a gaseous reactant (or product) to amount (n, mol), we can solve stoichiometry problems for gaseous reactions.

### Summary of Section 5.5
- The kinetic-molecular theory postulates that gas particles have no volume, move in random, straight-line paths between elastic (energy-conserving) collisions, and have average kinetic energies proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas.
- This theory explains the gas laws in terms of changes in distances between particles and the container walls, changes in molecular speed, and the energy of collisions.
- Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles.
- Effusion and diffusion rates are inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass (Graham’s law), because they are directly proportional to molecular speed.
- Molecular motion is characterized by a temperature-dependent, most probable speed (within a range of speeds), which affects mean free path and collision frequency.
- The atmosphere is a complex mixture of gases that exhibits variations in pressure and temperature with altitude. High temperatures in the upper atmosphere result from absorption of high-energy solar radiation. The lower atmosphere has a uniform composition as a result of convective mixing.

### Summary of Section 5.6
- At very high P or low T, all gases deviate significantly from ideal behavior.
- As external pressure increases, most real gases exhibit first a lower and then a higher $$ PV/RT $$; for 1 mol of an ideal gas, this ratio remains constant at 1.
- The deviations from ideal behavior are due to (1) attractions between particles, which lower the pressure (and decrease $$ PV/RT $$), and (2) the volume of the particles themselves, which takes up an increasingly larger fraction of the container volume (and increases $$ PV/RT $$).
- The van der Waals equation includes constants specific for a given gas to correct for deviations from ideal behavior. At ordinary P and T, the van der Waals equation reduces to the ideal gas equation.

### Summary of Section 6.1
- Internal energy (E) is transferred as heat (q) when the system and surroundings are at different temperatures or as work (w) when an object is moved by a force.
- Heat absorbed by a system (q > 0) or work done on a system (w > 0) increases the system’s E; heat released by a system (q < 0) or work done by a system (w < 0) decreases its E. The change in the internal energy is the sum of the heat and work: ΔE = q + w. Heat and work are measured in joules (J).
- Energy is always conserved: it can change from one form to another and be transferred into or out of a system, but the total quantity of energy in the universe (system plus surroundings) is constant.
- The internal energy of a system is a state function and, thus, is independent of how the system attained that energy; therefore, the same overall ΔE can occur through any combination of q and w.
- A system can lose energy by doing work of expansion (increase in volume) or gain energy by having work of contraction done on it (decrease in volume), both of which are forms of pressure-volume (PV) work.

### Summary of Section 6.2
- Enthalpy (H) is a state function, so any change in enthalpy (ΔH) is independent of how the change occurred. At constant P, the value of ΔH equals ΔE plus the PV work, which occurs when the volume of the system changes in the presence of an external pressure.
- ΔH equals $$ q_P $$, the heat released or absorbed during a chemical or physical change that takes place at constant pressure.
- In most cases, ΔH is equal, or very close, to ΔE.
- A change that releases heat is exothermic (ΔH < 0); a change that absorbs heat is endothermic (ΔH > 0).

### Summary of Section 6.3
- We calculate ΔH of a process by measuring the energy transferred as heat at constant pressure ($$ q_P $$). To do this, we determine ΔT and multiply it by the substance’s mass and by its specific heat capacity (c), which is the quantity of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 g of the substance by 1 K.
- Calorimeters measure the heat released (or absorbed) during a process either at constant pressure (coffee cup; $$ q_P = ΔH $$) or at constant volume (bomb; $$ q_V = ΔE $$).

### Summary of Section 6.4
- A thermochemical equation shows a balanced reaction and its ΔH value. The sign of ΔH for a forward reaction is opposite that for the reverse reaction. The magnitude of ΔH is specific for the given equation.
- The amount of a substance and the quantity of heat specified in a thermochemical equation are thermochemically equivalent and form a conversion factor for finding the quantity of heat transferred when any amount of the substance reacts.

### Summary of Section 6.5
- Because H is a state function, we can use Hess’s law to determine ΔH of any reaction by assuming that it is the sum of other reactions.
- After adjusting the equations of the other reactions and their ΔH values to match the substances in the target equation, we add the adjusted ΔH values to find the unknown ΔH.

### Summary of Section 6.6
- Standard states are a set of specific conditions used for determining thermodynamic variables for all substances.
- When 1 mol of a compound forms from its elements with all substances in their standard states, the enthalpy change is the standard enthalpy of formation, $$ ΔH_f^° $$.
- Hess’s law allows us to picture a reaction as the decomposition of the reactants to their elements followed by the formation of the products from their elements.
- We use tabulated $$ ΔH_f^° $$ values to find $$ ΔH_{rxn}^° $$ or use known $$ ΔH_{rxn}^° $$ and $$ ΔH_f^° $$ values to find an unknown $$ ΔH_f^° $$.
- Because of major concerns about climate change, chemists are developing energy alternatives, including coal and biomass conversion, hydrogen fuel, and noncombustible energy sources.

### Summary of Section 7.1
- Electromagnetic radiation travels in waves characterized by a given wavelength (λ) and frequency (ν).
- Electromagnetic waves travel through a vacuum at the speed of light, $$ c = 3.00×10^8 \, m/s $$, which equals $$ ν × λ $$. Therefore, wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional to each other.
- The intensity (brightness) of light is related to the amplitude of its waves.
- The electromagnetic spectrum ranges from very long radio waves to very short gamma rays and includes the visible region between wavelengths 750 nm (red) and 400 nm (violet).
- Refraction (change in a wave’s speed when entering a different medium) and diffraction (bend of a wave around an edge of an object) indicate that energy is wavelike, with properties distinct from those of particles of mass.
- Blackbody radiation and the photoelectric effect, however, are consistent with energy occurring in discrete packets, like particles.
- Light exists as photons (quanta) whose energy is directly proportional to the frequency.
- According to quantum theory, an atom has only certain quantities of energy (E = nhν), and it can change its energy only by absorbing or emitting a photon whose energy equals the change in the atom’s energy.

### Summary of Section 7.2
- Unlike sunlight, light emitted by electrically excited atoms of elements and refracted through a prism appears as separate spectral lines.
- Spectroscopists use an empirical formula (the Rydberg equation) to determine the wavelength of a spectral line. Atomic hydrogen displays several series of spectral lines.
- To explain the existence of line spectra, Bohr proposed that an electron moves in fixed orbits. It moves from one orbit to another when the atom absorbs or emits a photon whose energy equals the difference in energy levels (orbits).
- Bohr’s model predicts only the spectrum of the H atom and other one-electron species. Despite this, Bohr was correct that an atom’s energy is quantized.
- Spectrometry is an instrumental technique that uses emission and absorption spectra to identify substances and measure their concentrations.

### Summary of Section 7.3
- As a result of Planck’s quantum theory and Einstein’s theory of relativity, we no longer view matter and energy as distinct entities.
- The de Broglie wavelength is based on the idea that an electron (or any object) has wavelike motion. Allowed atomic energy levels are related to allowed wavelengths of the electron’s motion.
- Electrons exhibit diffraction, just as light waves do, and photons exhibit transfer of momentum, just as objects do. This wave-particle duality of matter and energy is observable only on the atomic scale.
- According to the uncertainty principle, we can never know simultaneously the position and speed of an electron.

### Summary of Section 7.4
- The atomic orbital (ψ, wave function) is a mathematical description of the electron’s wavelike behavior in an atom. The Schrödinger equation converts each allowed wave function to one of the atom’s energy states.
- The probability density of finding the electron at a particular location is represented by $$ψ^2$$. For a given energy level, an electron density diagram and a radial probability distribution plot show how the electron occupies the space near the nucleus.
- An atomic orbital is described by three quantum numbers: size (n), shape (l), and orientation ($$m_l$$): n limits l to n values, and l limits $$m_l$$ to $$2l + 1$$ values.
- An energy level has sublevels with the same n value; a sublevel has orbitals with the same n and l values but differing $$m_l$$ values.
- A sublevel with $$l = 0$$ has a spherical (s) orbital; a sublevel with $$l = 1$$ has three two-lobed (p) orbitals; a sublevel with $$l = 2$$ has five multilobed (d) orbitals; and a sublevel with $$l = 3$$ has seven multilobed (f) orbitals.
- In the special case of the H atom, the energy levels depend only on the n value.

### Summary of Section 8.1
- Identifying electrons in many-electron atoms requires four quantum numbers: three (n, l, $$m_l$$) describe the orbital, and a fourth ($$m_s$$) describes the electron’s spin.
- The Pauli exclusion principle requires each electron to have a unique set of four quantum numbers; therefore, an orbital can hold no more than two electrons, and their spins must be paired (opposite).
- Electrostatic interactions determine sublevel energies as follows:
  1. Greater nuclear charge lowers sublevel energy, making electrons harder to remove.
  2. Electron-electron repulsions raise sublevel energy, making electrons easier to remove. Repulsions shield electrons from the full nuclear charge, reducing it to an effective nuclear charge, $$Z_{eff}$$. Inner electrons shield outer electrons very effectively.
  3. Penetration makes an electron harder to remove because nuclear attraction increases and shielding decreases. As a result, an energy level is split into sublevels with the energy order $$s < p < d < f$$.

### Summary of Section 8.2
- In applying the aufbau principle, one electron is added to an atom of each successive element in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers) and Hund’s rule (orbitals of equal energy become half-filled, with electron spins parallel, before any pairing of spins occurs).
- For the main-group elements, valence electrons (those involved in reactions) are in the outer (highest energy) level only. For transition elements, ($$n - 1$$d) electrons are also considered valence electrons.
- Because of shielding of d electrons by electrons in inner sublevels and penetration by the ns electron, the ($$n - 1$$d) sublevel fills after the ns and before the np sublevels.
- In Periods 6 and 7, ($$n - 2$$f) orbitals fill between the first and second ($$n - 1$$d) orbitals.
- The elements of a group have similar outer electron configurations and similar chemical behavior.

### Summary of Section 8.3
- Trends in three atomic properties are summarized in Figure 8.20.
- Atomic size (half the distance between nuclei of adjacent atoms) increases down a main group and decreases across a period. In a transition series, size remains relatively constant.
- First ionization energy (the energy required to remove a mole of electrons from a mole of gaseous atoms or ions) is inversely related to atomic size: $$IE_1$$ decreases down a main group and increases across a period.
- Successive ionization energies of an element show a very large increase after all valence electrons have been removed, because the first inner (core) electron is in an orbital of much lower energy and so is held very tightly.
- Electron affinity (the energy involved in adding a mole of electrons to a mole of gaseous atoms or ions) shows many variations from expected trends.
- Based on the relative sizes of $$IEs$$ and $$EAs$$, Group 1A(1) and 2A(2) elements tend to form cations, and Group 6A(16) and 7A(17) elements tend to form anions in ionic compounds. Group 8A(18) elements are very unreactive.

### Summary of Section 8.4
- Metallic behavior correlates with large atomic size and low ionization energy. Thus, metallic behavior increases down a group and decreases from left to right across a period.
- Elements in Groups 1A(1) and 2A(2) are strong reducing agents; nonmetals in Groups 6A(16) and 7A(17) are strong oxidizing agents.
- Within the main groups, metal oxides are basic and nonmetal oxides acidic. Thus, oxides become more acidic across a period and more basic down a group.
- Many main-group elements form ions that are isoelectronic with the nearest noble gas. Removing (or adding) more electrons than needed to attain the noble gas configuration requires a prohibitive amount of energy.
- Metals in Groups 3A(13) to 5A(15) lose either their $$np$$ electrons or both their $$ns$$ and $$np$$ electrons.
- Transition metals lose $$ns$$ electrons before ($$n-1$$d) electrons and commonly form more than one ion.
- Many transition metals and their compounds are paramagnetic because their atoms (or ions) have unpaired electrons.
- Cations are smaller and anions larger than their parent atoms. Ionic radius increases down a group. Across a period, ionic radii generally decrease, but a large increase occurs from the last cation to the first anion.

### Summary of Section 9.1
- Nearly all naturally occurring substances consist of atoms or ions bonded to others. Chemical bonding allows atoms to lower their energy.
- Ionic bonding occurs when metal atoms transfer electrons to nonmetal atoms, and the resulting ions attract each other and form an ionic solid.
- Covalent bonding is most common between nonmetal atoms and usually results in individual molecules. Bonded atoms share one or more pairs of electrons that are localized between them.
- Metallic bonding occurs when many metal atoms pool their valence electrons into a delocalized electron “sea” that holds all the atoms in the sample together.
- The Lewis electron-dot symbol of a main-group atom shows valence electrons as dots surrounding the element symbol.
- The octet rule says that, when bonding, many atoms lose, gain, or share electrons to attain a filled outer level of eight (or two) electrons.

### Summary of Section 9.2
- In ionic bonding, a metal transfers electrons to a nonmetal, and the resulting ions attract each other to form a solid.
- Main-group elements often attain a filled outer level (either eight electrons or two electrons) by forming ions that have the electron configuration of the nearest noble gas.
- Ion formation by itself absorbs energy, but more than that quantity of energy is released when the ions form a solid. The high lattice energy of an ionic solid, the energy required to separate the solid into gaseous ions, is the reason the compound forms.
- The lattice energy is determined by applying Hess’s law in a Born-Haber cycle.
- Lattice energies increase with higher ionic charge and decrease with larger ionic radius (Coulomb’s law).
- According to the ionic bonding model, the strong electrostatic attractions that keep ions in position explain why ionic solids are hard, conduct a current only when melted or dissolved, and have high melting and boiling points.
- Ion pairs form when an ionic compound vaporizes.

### Summary of Section 9.3
- A shared, localized pair of valence electrons holds the nuclei of two atoms together in a covalent bond, filling each atom’s outer level.
- Bond order is the number of shared pairs between two atoms. Bond energy (strength) is the energy absorbed to separate the atoms; the same quantity of energy is released when the bond forms. Bond length is the distance between the nuclei of the two atoms.
- For a given pair of atoms, bond order is directly related to bond energy and inversely related to bond length.
- Molecular covalent substances are soft and low melting because of the weak forces between the molecules, not the strong bonding forces within them. Network covalent solids are hard and high melting because covalent bonds join all the atoms in the sample.
- Most covalent substances have low electrical conductivity because their electrons are localized and ions are absent.
- Atoms in a covalent bond vibrate, and the energies of these vibrations are studied with IR spectroscopy.

### Summary of Section 9.4
- The only component of internal energy that changes significantly during a reaction is the bond energies of reactants and products, and this change appears as the enthalpy of reaction, $$ΔH°_{rxn}$$.
- A reaction involves breaking reactant bonds and forming product bonds. Applying Hess’s law, we use tabulated bond energies to calculate $$ΔH°_{rxn}$$.
- Bonds in fuels are weaker (less stable, higher energy) than bonds in the combustion products. Fuels with more weak bonds release more energy than fuels with fewer.

### Summary of Section 9.5
- Electronegativity is the ability of a bonded atom to attract shared electrons, which generates opposite partial charges at the ends of the bond and contributes to the bond energy.
- Electronegativity increases across a period and decreases down a group, the reverse of the trends in atomic size.
- The larger the $$ΔEN$$ for two bonded atoms, the more polar the bond is and the greater its ionic character.
- For Period 3 chlorides, there is a gradation in bond type from ionic to polar covalent to nonpolar covalent.

### Summary of Section 9.6
- According to the electron-sea model, the valence electrons of the metal atoms in a sample are highly delocalized and attract all the metal cations, holding them together.
- Metals have only moderately high melting points because the metal ions remain attracted to the electrons in the electron sea, even if their relative positions change.
- Vaporization involves complete separation of individual cations with their valence electrons from all the others, so metals have very high boiling points.
- Metals can be deformed because the electron sea prevents repulsions among the cations.
- Metals conduct electricity and heat because their electrons are mobile.

### Summary of Section 10.1
- A stepwise process converts a molecular formula into a Lewis structure, a two-dimensional representation of a molecule (or ion) that shows the placement of atoms and the distribution of valence electrons among bonding and lone pairs.
- When two or more Lewis structures can be drawn for the same relative placement of atoms, the actual structure is a hybrid of those resonance structures.
- Formal charges can be useful for choosing the more important contributor to the hybrid, but experimental data always determine the choice.
- Molecules with an electron-deficient atom (central Be or B) or an odd-electron atom (free radicals) have less than an octet around the central atom but often attain an octet in reactions.
- In a molecule (or ion) with a central atom from Period 3 or higher, that atom can have more than eight valence electrons because it is larger and has empty d orbitals for expanding its valence shell.

### Summary of Section 10.2
- VSEPR theory proposes that each electron group (single bond, multiple bond, lone pair, or lone electron) around a central atom remains as far from the others as possible.
- Five electron-group arrangements are possible when two, three, four, five, or six electron groups surround a central atom. Each arrangement is associated with one or more molecular shapes, depending on the numbers of bonding and lone pairs.
- Ideal bond angles are based on the regular geometric arrangements. Deviations from them occur when surrounding atoms and/or electron groups are not identical.
- Lone pairs and double bonds exert stronger repulsions on other electron groups than single bonds do.
- Shapes of larger molecules are composites of the shapes around each central atom.

### Summary of Section 10.3
- Bond polarity and molecular shape determine molecular polarity, which is measured as a dipole moment.
- A molecule with polar bonds is not necessarily a polar molecule. When bond polarities cancel each other, the molecule is nonpolar; when they reinforce each other, the molecule is polar.
- Molecular shape and polarity can affect physical properties, such as boiling point, and they play a central role in biological function.

### Summary of Section 11.1
- VB theory explains that a covalent bond forms when two atomic orbitals overlap and two electrons with paired (opposite) spins occupy the overlap region.
- To explain molecular shape, VB theory proposes that, during bonding, atomic orbitals mix to form hybrid orbitals whose shape and orientation differ from those of the mixed atomic orbitals. This process gives rise to greater orbital overlap and, thus, stronger bonds.
- Based on an observed molecular shape (and the related electron-group arrangement), we postulate the type of hybrid orbital that accounts for that shape. In many cases, especially for molecules with larger central atoms, the concept of hybridization has major limitations.

### Summary of Section 11.2
- End-to-end overlap of atomic orbitals forms a σ bond, which allows free rotation of the bonded parts of the molecule.
- A multiple bond consists of a σ bond and either one π bond (double bond) or two π bonds (triple bond). Multiple bonds have greater electron density between the nuclei than single bonds do and, thus, higher bond energies.
- Side-to-side overlap of orbitals in a π bond restricts rotation.

### Summary of Section 11.3
- Molecular orbital (MO) theory treats a molecule as a collection of nuclei with MOs delocalized over the entire structure.
- Atomic orbitals of comparable energy can be added or subtracted to obtain bonding or antibonding MOs, respectively.
- Bonding MOs, whether σ or π, have most of the electron density between the nuclei and are lower in energy than the AOs that combine to form them; most of the electron density in antibonding MOs does not lie between the nuclei, so these MOs are higher in energy.
- MOs are filled in order of their energy with paired electrons having opposite spins.
- MO diagrams show energy levels and orbital occupancy. Diagrams for the Period 2 homonuclear diatomic molecules explain bond energy, bond length, and magnetic behavior.
- In heteronuclear diatomic molecules, the more electronegative atom contributes more to the bonding MOs.
- MO theory eliminates the need for resonance forms to depict polyatomic molecules.

### Summary of Section 12.1
- Because of the relative magnitudes of intermolecular forces (potential energy) and average speed (kinetic energy), the particles in a gas are far apart and moving randomly, those in a liquid are in contact and moving relative to each other, and those in a solid are in contact and in fixed positions. These molecular-level differences account for macroscopic differences in shape, compressibility, and ability to flow.
- When a solid becomes a liquid (melting, or fusion), a liquid becomes a gas (vaporization), or a solid becomes a gas (sublimation), energy is absorbed to overcome intermolecular forces and increase the average distance between particles. As particles come closer together in the reverse changes (freezing, condensation, and deposition), energy is released. Each phase change is associated with a given enthalpy change under specified conditions.

### Summary of Section 12.2
- A heating-cooling curve depicts the change in temperature when a substance absorbs or releases heat at a constant rate. Within a phase, temperature (and average $$E_k$$) changes. During a phase change, temperature (and average $$E_k$$) is constant, but $$E_p$$ changes. The total enthalpy change for the system is found using Hess’s law.
- In a closed container, the liquid and gas phases of a substance reach equilibrium. The vapor pressure, the pressure of the gas at equilibrium, increases with temperature and decreases with the strength of the intermolecular forces.
- The Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates the vapor pressure to the temperature and is often used to find $$ΔH_{vap}$$.
- A liquid in an open container boils when the vapor pressure inside bubbles forming in the liquid equals the external pressure.
- Solid-liquid equilibrium occurs at the melting point. Some solids sublime because they have very weak intermolecular forces.
- The phase diagram of a substance shows the phase that is stable at any P and T, the conditions at which phase changes occur, and the conditions at the critical point and the triple point. Water differs from most substances in that its solid phase is less dense than its liquid phase, so its solid-liquid line has a negative slope.

### Summary of Section 12.3
- The van der Waals radius determines the shortest distance over which intermolecular forces operate; it is always larger than the covalent radius.
- Intermolecular forces are much weaker than bonding (intramolecular) forces.
- Ion-dipole forces occur between ions and polar molecules.
- Dipole-dipole forces occur between oppositely charged poles on polar molecules.
- Hydrogen bonding, a special type of dipole-dipole force, occurs when H bonded to N, O, or F is attracted to the lone pair of N, O, or F in another molecule.
- Electron clouds can be distorted (polarized) in an electric field.
- Ion– and dipole–induced dipole forces arise between a charge and the dipole it induces in another molecule.
- Dispersion (London) forces are instantaneous dipole–induced dipole forces that occur among all particles and increase with number of electrons (molar mass). Molecular shape determines the extent of contact between molecules and can be a factor in the strength of dispersion forces.

### Summary of Section 12.4
- Surface tension is a measure of the energy required to increase a liquid’s surface area. Greater intermolecular forces within a liquid create higher surface tension.
- Capillarity, the rising of a liquid through a narrow space, occurs when the forces between a liquid and a surface (adhesive) are greater than those in the liquid (cohesive).
- Viscosity, the resistance to flow, depends on molecular shape and decreases with temperature. Stronger intermolecular forces create higher viscosity.

### Summary of Section 12.5
- The atomic properties of H and O result in water’s bent molecular shape, polarity, and H-bonding ability.
- These properties give water the ability to dissolve many ionic and polar compounds.
- Water’s high specific heat capacity and heat of vaporization give Earth and its organisms a narrow temperature range.
- Water’s high surface tension and capillarity are essential to plants and animals.
- Because water expands on freezing, lake life survives in winter, nutrients mix from seasonal density changes, and soil forms through freeze-thaw stress on rocks.

### Summary of Section 12.6
- Particles in crystalline solids lie at points that form a structure of repeating unit cells.
- The three types of unit cells of the cubic system are simple, body-centered, and face-centered. The highest packing efficiency occurs with cubic (face-centered) and hexagonal closest packing.
- Bond angles and distances in a crystal are determined with x-ray diffraction analysis and scanning tunneling microscopy. These data are used to determine atomic radii.
- Atomic solids [Group 8A(18)] adopt cubic closest packing, with atoms held together by weak dispersion forces.
- Molecular solids have molecules at the lattice points and often adopt cubic closest packing. Combinations of intermolecular forces (dispersion, dipole-dipole, and H bonding) result in physical properties that vary greatly.
- Ionic solids crystallize with one ion filling holes in the cubic closest packed array of the other. High melting points and hardness and low conductivity arise from strong ionic attractions.
- Most metals have a closest packed structure. Their physical properties result from the high packing efficiency and the presence of delocalized electrons.
- Atoms of network covalent solids are covalently bonded throughout the sample, so these substances have very high melting and boiling points.
- Amorphous solids have little regularity in their structure.
- Band theory proposes that atomic orbitals of many atoms combine to form a continuum, or band, of molecular orbitals. Metals are electrical conductors because electrons move freely from the filled (valence) band to the empty (conduction) band. Insulators have a large energy gap between the two portions, and semiconductors have a small gap, which can be bridged by heating.

### Summary of Section 12.7
- Doping increases the conductivity of semiconductors and is essential to modern electronic materials. Doping silicon with Group 5A(15) atoms introduces negative sites (creating an n-type semiconductor) by adding valence electrons to the conduction band, whereas doping with Group 3A(13) atoms adds positive holes (for a p-type semiconductor) by emptying some orbitals in the valence band. Placing these two types of semiconductors in contact with one another forms a p-n junction. Sandwiching a p-type portion between two n-type portions forms a transistor.
- Liquid crystal phases flow like liquids but have molecules ordered like crystalline solids. Typically, the molecules have rodlike shapes, and their intermolecular forces keep them aligned. Thermotropic phases are prepared by heating the solid; lyotropic phases form when the solvent concentration is varied. The nematic, cholesteric, and smectic phases of liquid crystals differ in their molecular order. Liquid crystal applications depend on controlling the orientation of the molecules.
- Ceramics are very resistant to heat and chemicals. Most are network covalent solids formed at high temperature from simple reactants. They add lightweight strength to other materials.
- Polymers are extremely large molecules that adopt the shape of a random coil, as a result of intermolecular forces. A polymer sample has an average molar mass because it consists of chains with a range of lengths. The high viscosity of a polymer arises from attractions between chains or, in the case of a dissolved polymer, between chains and solvent. By varying the degrees of branching, crosslinking, and ordering (crystallinity), chemists tailor polymers with specific properties.
- Nanotechnology employs nanoscale systems with sizes of 1–100 nm in a variety of applications.

### Summary of Section 13.1
- A solution is a homogeneous mixture of a solute dissolved in a solvent through the action of intermolecular forces.
- Ion-dipole, ion–induced dipole, and dipole–induced dipole forces occur in solutions, in addition to all the intermolecular forces that also occur in pure substances.
- If similar intermolecular forces occur in solute and solvent, they replace each other when the substances mix and a solution is likely to form (the like-dissolves-like rule).
- When ionic compounds dissolve in water, the ions become surrounded by hydration shells of H-bonded water molecules.
- Solubility of organic molecules in various solvents depends on the relative sizes of their polar and nonpolar portions.
- The solubility of nonpolar gases in water is low because of weak intermolecular forces. Gases are miscible with one another and dissolve in solids by fitting into spaces in the crystal structure.
- Solid-solid solutions include alloys (some of which are formed by mixing molten components) and waxes.

### Summary of Section 13.2
- In soluble proteins, polar and ionic amino-acid side chains on the exterior interact with surrounding water, and nonpolar side chains in the interior interact with each other.
- With polar-ionic heads and nonpolar tails, a soap dissolves grease and interacts with water.
- Like soaps, phospholipids have dual polarity. They assemble into a water-impermeable lipid bilayer. In a cell membrane, the embedded portions of membrane proteins have exterior nonpolar side chains that interact with the nonpolar tails in the lipid bilayer through dispersion forces. Some antibiotics form channels with nonpolar exteriors and polar interiors that shuttle ions through the cell membrane.
- DNA forms a double helix with a sugar-phosphate, polar-ionic exterior. In the interior, N-containing bases H bond in specific pairs and stack through dispersion forces.

### Summary of Section 13.3
- In a thermochemical solution cycle, the heat of solution is the sum of the endothermic separations of solute and of solvent and the exothermic mixing of their particles.
- In water, solvation (surrounding solute particles with solvent) is called hydration. For ions, heats of hydration depend on the ion’s charge density but are always negative because ion-dipole forces are strong. Charge density exhibits periodic trends.
- Systems naturally increase their entropy (distribute their energy in more ways). A gas has higher entropy than a liquid, which has higher entropy than a solid, and a solution has higher entropy than the pure solute and solvent.
- Relative sizes of the enthalpy and entropy changes determine solution formation. A substance with a positive $$ΔH_{soln}$$ dissolves only if $$ΔS_{soln}$$ is larger than $$ΔH_{soln}$$.

### Summary of Section 13.4
- A solution that contains the maximum amount of dissolved solute in the presence of excess undissolved solute is saturated. A saturated solution is in equilibrium with excess solute, because solute particles are entering and leaving the solution at the same rate. An unsaturated solution contains less than this amount.
- Most solids are more soluble at higher temperatures.
- All gases have a negative $$ΔH_{soln}$$ in water, so heating lowers gas solubility in water.
- Henry’s law says that the solubility of a gas is directly proportional to its partial pressure above the solution.

### Summary of Section 13.5
- The concentration of a solution is independent of the quantity of solution and can be expressed as molarity (mol solute/L solution), molality (mol solute/kg solvent), parts by mass (mass solute/mass solution), parts by volume (volume solute/volume solution), or mole fraction [mol solute/(mol solute + mol solvent)].
- Molality is based on mass, so it is independent of temperature; the mole fraction gives the proportion of dissolved particles.
- If the quantities of solute and solution as well as the solution density are known, the various ways of expressing concentration are interconvertible.

### Summary of Section 13.6
- Colligative properties arise from the number, not the type, of dissolved solute particles.
- Compared to pure solvent, a solution has higher entropy, which results in lower vapor pressure (Raoult’s law), elevated boiling point, and depressed freezing point. A difference in concentration of a solute between two solutions gives rise to osmotic pressure.
- Colligative properties are used to determine solute molar mass; osmotic pressure gives the most precise measurements.
- When solute and solvent are volatile, each lowers the vapor pressure of the other, with the vapor pressure of the more volatile component greater. When the vapor is condensed, the new solution is richer in that component than the original solution.
- Calculating colligative properties of strong electrolyte solutions requires a factor (i) that adjusts for the number of ions per formula unit. These solutions exhibit nonideal behavior because charge attractions effectively reduce the concentration of ions.

### Summary of Section 13.7
- Particles in a colloid are smaller than those in a suspension and larger than those in a solution.
- Colloids are classified by the physical states of the dispersed and dispersing substances and involve many combinations of gas, liquid, and/or solid.
- Colloids have extremely large surface areas, scatter incoming light (Tyndall effect), and exhibit random (Brownian) motion.
- Colloidal particles in water are stabilized by charged surfaces that keep them dispersed, but they can be coagulated by heating or by the addition of ions.
- Solution behavior and colloid chemistry are applied to water treatment and purification.

### Summary of Section 15.1
- Carbon’s small size, intermediate electronegativity, four valence electrons, and ability to form multiple bonds result in the structural complexity of organic compounds.
- These factors lead to carbon’s ability to catenate, which creates chains, branches, and rings of C atoms. Small size and the absence of d orbitals in the valence level lead to strong, chemically resistant bonds that point in as many as four directions from each C.
- Carbon’s ability to bond to many other elements, especially O and N, creates polar, reactive bonds, which leads to the chemical diversity of organic compounds.
- Most organic compounds contain functional groups, specific combinations of bonded atoms that react in characteristic ways.

### Summary of Section 15.2
- Hydrocarbons contain only C and H atoms, so their physical properties depend on the strength of their dispersion forces.
- Names of organic compounds consist of a root for the longest chain, a prefix for any attached group, and a suffix for the type of compound.
- Alkanes ($$C_nH_{2n+2}$$) have only single bonds. Cycloalkanes ($$C_nH_{2n}$$) have ring structures that are typically nonplanar. Alkenes ($$C_nH_{2n}$$) have at least one $$C=C$$ bond. Alkynes ($$C_nH_{2n−2}$$) have at least one $$C≡C$$ bond. Aromatic hydrocarbons have at least one planar ring with delocalized π electrons.
- Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different properties.
- Constitutional (structural) isomers have different arrangements of atoms.
- Stereoisomers (optical and geometric) have the same arrangement of atoms, but their atoms are oriented differently in space. Optical isomers cannot be superimposed on each other because they are asymmetric, with four different groups bonded to the C that is the chiral center. They have identical physical and chemical properties except in their rotation of plane-polarized light, their reactivity with chiral reactants, and their biological activity. Geometric (cis-trans) isomers have groups oriented differently around a $$C=C$$ bond, which restricts rotation.
- Light converts a cis isomer of retinal to the all-trans form, which initiates the process of vision.
- Boron, silicon, and sulfur also form catenated hydrides, but these are unstable.
- $$^{1}H$$-NMR spectroscopy indicates the relative numbers of H atoms in the various environments within an organic molecule.

### Summary of Section 15.3
- In an addition reaction, a π bond breaks, and the two C atoms (or one C and one O) are bonded to more atoms in the product.
- In an elimination reaction, a π bond forms, with the two C atoms bonded to fewer atoms in the product.
- In a substitution reaction, one atom bonded to C is replaced by another, but the total number of atoms bonded to the C does not change.
- In an organic redox reaction, the organic reactant is oxidized if at least one of its C atoms forms more bonds to O atoms (or fewer bonds to H atoms), and it is reduced if one of its C atoms forms more bonds to H (or fewer bonds to O).

### Summary of Section 15.4
- Organic reactions are initiated when regions of high and low electron density in reactant molecules attract each other.
- Functional groups containing only single bonds—alcohols, haloalkanes, and amines—undergo substitution and elimination reactions.
- Functional groups with double or triple bonds—alkenes, aldehydes, ketones, alkynes, and nitriles—mostly undergo addition reactions.
- Aromatic compounds typically undergo substitution, rather than addition, because delocalization of the π electrons stabilizes the ring.
- Functional groups with both double and single bonds—carboxylic acids, esters, and amides—undergo substitution (addition plus elimination) reactions.
- Many reactions change one functional group to another, but some, including reactions with organometallic compounds and with the cyanide ion, change the carbon skeleton.

### Summary of Section 15.5
- Polymers are extremely large molecules that are made of repeat units called monomers.
- Addition polymers are formed from unsaturated monomers that commonly link through free-radical reactions.
- Most condensation polymers are formed by linking monomers that each have two functional groups through a dehydration-condensation reaction.
- Reaction conditions, catalysts, and monomers can be varied to produce polymers with different properties.

### Summary of Section 15.6
- The three types of natural polymers—polysaccharides, proteins, and nucleic acids—are formed by dehydration-condensation reactions.
- Polysaccharides are formed from cyclic monosaccharides, such as glucose. Cellulose, starch, and glycogen have structural or energy-storage roles.
- Proteins are polyamides formed from as many as 20 different types of amino acids. Fibrous proteins have extended shapes and play structural roles. Globular proteins have compact shapes and play metabolic, immunologic, and hormonal roles. The amino acid sequence of a protein determines its shape and function.
- Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are polynucleotides consisting of four different types of mononucleotides. The base sequence of the DNA chain determines the sequence of amino acids in an organism’s proteins. Hydrogen bonding between specific base pairs is the key to protein synthesis and DNA replication.
- DNA sequencing is used to determine the identity and order of nucleotides in a fragment of a DNA chain. DNA fingerprinting is used to identify a person from the unique sequence of bases in his or her DNA.

### Summary of Section 16.1
- Chemical kinetics focuses on reaction rate and the factors that affect it.
- Under a given set of conditions, each reaction has its own rate.
- Concentration affects rate by influencing the frequency of collisions between reactant molecules.
- Physical state affects rate by determining how well reactants can mix.
- Temperature affects rate by influencing the frequency and, more importantly, the energy of the collisions between reactant molecules.

### Summary of Section 16.2
- The average reaction rate is the change in reactant (or product) concentration over a change in time, $$Δt$$. The rate slows as the reaction proceeds because reactants are used up.
- The instantaneous rate at time $$t$$ is the slope of the tangent to a curve that plots concentration vs. time.
- The initial rate, the instantaneous rate at $$t = 0$$, occurs when reactants have just been mixed and before any product accumulates.
- The expression for a reaction rate and its numerical value depend on which reaction component is being referenced.

### Summary of Section 16.3
- An experimentally determined rate law shows how the rate of a reaction depends on concentration. Considering only initial rates (that is, no products), the expression for a general rate law is $$ \text{rate} = k[A]^m[B]^n $$. This reaction is $$m$$th order with respect to $$A$$ and $$n$$th order with respect to $$B$$; the overall reaction order is $$m + n$$.
- With an accurate method for obtaining initial rates, reaction orders are determined experimentally by varying the concentration of one reactant at a time to see its effect on the rate.
- By substituting the known rate, concentrations, and reaction orders into the rate law, we solve for the rate constant, $$k$$.

### Summary of Section 16.4
- Integrated rate laws are used to find either the time needed to reach a certain concentration of reactant or the concentration present after a given time.
- The half-life is the time needed for the reactant concentration to reach half its initial value; for first-order reactions, the half-life is constant, that is, independent of concentration.
- Rearrangements of the integrated rate laws that give equations that graph as a straight line allow us to determine reaction orders and rate constants graphically.

### Summary of Section 16.5
- According to collision theory, reactant particles must collide to react, and the number of possible collisions is found by multiplying the numbers of reactant particles.
- The activation energy, $$E_a$$, is the minimum energy needed for colliding particles to react.
- The relative $$E_a$$ values for the forward and reverse reactions depend on whether the overall reaction is exothermic or endothermic.
- Molecules must collide with an effective orientation for them to react, so structural complexity decreases rate.
- Transition state theory focuses on the change of kinetic energy to potential energy as reactant particles collide and form an unstable transition state.
- Given a sufficiently energetic collision and an effective molecular orientation, the reactant species form the transition state, which either continues toward product(s) or reverts to reactant(s).
- A reaction energy diagram depicts the changing potential energy throughout a reaction’s progress from reactants through transition states to products.
- At higher temperatures, more collisions have enough energy to exceed $$E_a$$.
- As the Arrhenius equation shows, a rise in temperature increases the rate because it increases the rate constant.
- $$E_a$$ can be determined graphically from $$k$$ values obtained at different $$T$$ values.

### Summary of Section 16.6
- The mechanisms of most common reactions consist of two or more elementary steps, each of which describes a single molecular event.
- The molecularity of an elementary step equals the number of reactant particles and is the same as the total reaction order of the step. Only unimolecular and bimolecular steps are reasonable.

### Summary of Section 16.7
- A catalyst increases the rate of a reaction without being consumed. It accomplishes this by providing another mechanism that has a lower activation energy.
- Homogeneous catalysts function in the same phase as the reactants. Heterogeneous catalysts act in a different phase from the reactants.
- The hydrogenation of carbon-carbon double bonds takes place on a solid metal catalyst, which speeds up the rate-determining step, the breakage of the $$H_2$$ bond.
- Enzymes are protein catalysts of high efficiency and specificity that act by stabilizing the transition state and, thus, lowering the activation energy.
- Chlorine atoms from CFC molecules speed the breakdown of stratospheric $$O_3$$ in a process that is affected by both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.

### Summary of Section 17.1
- Kinetics and equilibrium are distinct aspects of a reaction system, and the rate and extent of a reaction are not necessarily related.
- When the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate, concentrations no longer change and the system has reached equilibrium.
- The equilibrium constant (K) is a number based on a particular ratio of product and reactant concentrations: $$K$$ is small if a high concentration of reactant(s) is present at equilibrium, and it is large if a high concentration of product(s) is present at equilibrium.

### Summary of Section 17.2
- The reaction quotient based on concentration, $$Q_c$$, is a particular ratio of product to reactant concentrations. The value of $$Q_c$$ changes as the reaction proceeds. When the system reaches equilibrium at a particular temperature, $$Q_c = K_c$$.
- The concentration terms for pure liquids or solids do not appear in $$Q$$ because they are equal to 1.
- The form of $$Q$$ is based on the balanced equation exactly as written, so it changes if the equation is reversed or multiplied by some factor, and $$K$$ changes accordingly.
- If a reaction is the sum of two or more steps, the overall $$Q$$ (or $$K$$) is the product of the individual $$Q$$’s (or $$K$$’s).
- Three criteria define a system at equilibrium:
  1. Reactant and product concentrations are constant over time.
  2. The opposing reaction rates are equal: $$ \text{rate}_{\text{fwd}} = \text{rate}_{\text{rev}} $$.
  3. The reaction quotient equals the equilibrium constant: $$ Q = K $$.

### Summary of Section 17.3
- For a gaseous reaction, the reaction quotient and the equilibrium constant can be expressed in terms of partial pressures ($$Q_p$$ and $$K_p$$).
- If you know $$K_p$$, you can find $$K_c$$, and vice versa: $$ K_p = K_c(RT)^{\Delta n_{\text{gas}}} $$.

### Summary of Section 17.4
- We compare the values of $$Q$$ and $$K$$ to determine the direction in which a reaction will proceed toward equilibrium.
  - If $$ Q_c < K_c $$, more product forms.
  - If $$ Q_c > K_c $$, more reactant forms.
  - If $$ Q_c = K_c $$, there is no further net change.

### Summary of Section 17.5
- In equilibrium problems, we typically use quantities (concentrations or pressures) of reactants and products to find $$K$$, or we use $$K$$ to find quantities.
- Reaction tables summarize the initial quantities, their changes during the reaction, and the equilibrium quantities.
- To simplify calculations, we assume that, if $$K$$ is small and the initial quantity of reactant is large, the unknown change in reactant ($$x$$) can be neglected. If this assumption is not justified (that is, if the resulting error is greater than 5%), we use the quadratic formula to find $$x$$.
- For reactions that start with a mixture of reactants and products, we first determine reaction direction by comparing $$Q$$ and $$K$$ to decide on the sign of $$x$$.

### Summary of Section 17.6
- If a system at equilibrium is disturbed, it undergoes a net reaction that reduces the disturbance and returns the system to equilibrium.
- Changes in concentration cause a net reaction to consume the added component or to produce the removed component.
- For a reaction that involves a change in amount (mol) of gas, an increase in pressure (decrease in volume) causes a net reaction toward fewer moles of gas, and a decrease in pressure causes the opposite change.
- Although the equilibrium position changes as a result of a concentration or volume change, $$K$$ does not.
- A temperature change affects $$K$$: higher $$T$$ increases $$K$$ for an endothermic reaction (positive $$ΔH°_{rxn}$$) and decreases $$K$$ for an exothermic reaction (negative $$ΔH°_{rxn}$$).
- A catalyst causes the system to reach equilibrium more quickly by speeding forward and reverse reactions equally, but it does not affect the equilibrium position.
- Ammonia is produced in a process favored by high pressure, low temperature, and continual removal of product. To make the process economical, intermediate temperature and pressure and a catalyst are used.
- A metabolic pathway is a cellular reaction sequence with each step shifted completely toward product. Its overall yield is controlled by a feedback system that inhibits the activity of certain key enzymes.

### Summary of Section 18.1
- In aqueous solution, water binds the proton released from an acid to form a hydrated species represented by $$H_3O^+(aq)$$.
- By the Arrhenius definition, acids contain $$H$$ and yield $$H_3O^+$$ in water, bases contain $$OH$$ and yield $$OH^-$$ in water, and an acid-base reaction (neutralization) is the reaction of $$H^+$$ and $$OH^-$$ to form $$H_2O$$.

### Summary of Section 18.2
- The Brønsted-Lowry acid-base definition does not require that bases contain $$OH$$ in their formula or that acid-base reactions occur in aqueous solution.
- An acid is a species that donates a proton and a base is one that accepts it, so an acid-base reaction is a proton-transfer process.
- When an acid donates a proton, it becomes the conjugate base; when a base accepts a proton, it becomes the conjugate acid. In an acid-base reaction, acids and bases form their conjugates. A stronger acid has a weaker conjugate base, and vice versa.
- An acid-base reaction proceeds to the greater extent ($$K > 1$$) in the direction in which a stronger acid and base form a weaker base and acid.

### Summary of Section 18.3
- Pure water has a low conductivity because it autoionizes to a small extent in a process whose equilibrium constant is the ion-product constant for water, $$K_w$$ (1.0×10−14 at 25°C).
- $$[H_3O^+]$$ and $$[OH^-]$$ are inversely related: in acidic solution, $$[H_3O^+]$$ is greater than $$[OH^-]$$; the reverse is true in basic solution; and the two are equal in neutral solution.
- To express small values of $$[H_3O^+]$$, we use the pH scale: $$ \text{pH} = -\log [H_3O^+] $$. Similarly, $$ \text{pOH} = -\log [OH^-] $$.
- A high pH corresponds to a low $$[H_3O^+]$$. In acidic solutions, $$ \text{pH} < 7.00 $$; in basic solutions, $$ \text{pH} > 7.00 $$; and, in neutral solutions, $$ \text{pH} = 7.00 $$. The sum of pH and pOH equals $$ \text{p}K_w $$ (14.00 at 25°C).
- A pH is typically measured with either an acid-base indicator or a pH meter.

### Summary of Section 18.4
- Strong acids and strong bases dissociate completely in water; we do not express their dissociation reactions as equilibrium processes.
- $$ \text{pH} $$, $$ \text{pOH} $$, $$[H_3O^+]$$, and $$[OH^-]$$ are calculated directly from the concentration of the strong acid or base.

### Summary of Section 18.5
- Weak acids dissociate slightly; the extent of dissociation is expressed by the acid dissociation constant, $$K_a$$. Most weak acids have $$K_a$$ values ranging from about $$10^{-2}$$ to $$10^{-10}$$.
- Two types of weak-acid equilibrium problems involve finding $$K_a$$ from a given concentration and finding a concentration from a given $$K_a$$.
- We simplify the arithmetic by assuming (1) that $$[H_3O^+]$$ from $$H_2O$$ is much smaller than $$[H_3O^+]$$ from $$HA$$ and can be neglected and (2) that weak acids dissociate so little that $$[HA]_{init} \approx [HA]$$ at equilibrium.
- The fraction of weak-acid molecules that dissociate is greater in a more dilute solution, even though the total $$[H_3O^+]$$ is lower.
- Polyprotic acids have more than one ionizable proton, but we assume that the first dissociation provides virtually all the $$H_3O^+$$.

### Summary of Section 18.6
- For nonmetal hydrides, acid strength increases across a period, with the electronegativity of the nonmetal (E), and down a group, with the length of the $$E−H$$ bond.
- For oxoacids with the same number of O atoms, acid strength increases with electronegativity of E; for oxoacids with the same E, acid strength increases with number of O atoms (or O.N. of E).
- Small, highly charged metal ions are acidic in water because they withdraw electron density from the $$O−H$$ bonds of bound $$H_2O$$ molecules, releasing an $$H^+$$ ion to the solution.

### Summary of Section 18.8
- Salts that yield a neutral solution consist of ions that do not react with water.
- Salts that yield an acidic solution contain an unreactive anion (from a strong acid) and a cation that releases a proton to water.
- Salts that yield a basic solution contain an unreactive cation (from a strong base) and an anion that accepts a proton from water.
- If both cation and anion react with water, the ion that reacts to the greater extent (higher $$K$$) determines the acidity or basicity of the salt solution.
- If the anion is amphiprotic (from a polyprotic acid), the strength of the anion as an acid ($$K_a$$) or as a base ($$K_b$$) determines the acidity of the salt solution.

### Summary of Section 18.9
- Strong acids (or strong bases) dissociate completely to yield $$H_3O^+$$ (or $$OH^−$$) in water; in effect, water equalizes (levels) their strengths.
- Strong acids show differences in strength when dissolved in a weaker base than water, such as acetic acid.

### Summary of Section 18.10
- The Lewis acid-base definition focuses on the donation or acceptance of an electron pair to form a new covalent bond in an adduct, the product of an acid-base reaction. Lewis bases donate the electron pair, and Lewis acids accept it.
- Thus, many species that do not contain $$H$$ are Lewis acids. Molecules with polar double bonds act as Lewis acids, as do those with electron-deficient atoms.
- Metal ions act as Lewis acids when they dissolve in water, which acts as a Lewis base, to form a hydrated cation as the adduct.
- Many metal ions function as Lewis acids in biomolecules.

### Summary of Section 19.1
- The pH of a buffered solution changes much less than the pH of an unbuffered solution when $$H_3O^+$$ or $$OH^−$$ is added.
- A buffer consists of a weak acid and its conjugate base (or a weak base and its conjugate acid). To be effective, the amounts of the components must be much greater than the amount of $$H_3O^+$$ or $$OH^−$$ added.
- The buffer-component concentration ratio determines the pH; the ratio and the pH are related by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.
- When $$H_3O^+$$ or $$OH^−$$ is added to a buffer, one component reacts to form the other; thus, $$[H_3O^+]$$ (and pH) changes only slightly.
- A concentrated (higher capacity) buffer undergoes smaller changes in pH than a dilute buffer. When the buffer pH equals the $$pK_a$$ of the acid component, the buffer has its highest capacity.
- A buffer has an effective pH range of $$pK_a ± 1$$ pH unit.
- To prepare a buffer, choose the conjugate acid-base pair, calculate the ratio of components, determine the buffer concentration, and adjust the final solution to the desired pH.

### Summary of Section 19.2
- In a strong acid–strong base titration, the pH starts out low, rises slowly, then shoots up near the equivalence point (pH = 7).
- In a weak acid–strong base titration, the pH starts out higher, rises slowly in the buffer region (pH = $$pK_a$$ at the midpoint), and then rises quickly near the equivalence point (pH > 7).
- A weak base–strong acid titration curve has a shape that is the inverse of the weak acid–strong base case, with the pH decreasing to the equivalence point (pH < 7).
- An acid-base (pH) indicator is a weak acid that has a differently colored conjugate base form and changes color over about 2 pH units.
- Polyprotic acids have two or more acidic protons, each with its own $$K_a$$ value. Because the $$K_a$$’s differ by several orders of magnitude, each proton is titrated separately.
- Amino acids exist in charged forms that depend on the pH of the solution and determine the overall charge of a protein, which can affect the protein’s function.

### Summary of Section 19.3
- Only as a first approximation does the dissolved portion of a slightly soluble salt dissociate completely into ions.
- In a saturated solution, dissolved ions and the undissolved solid salt are in equilibrium. The product of the ion concentrations, each raised to the power of its subscript in the formula, has a constant value ($$Q_{sp} = K_{sp}$$).
- The value of $$K_{sp}$$ can be obtained from the solubility, and vice versa.
- Adding a common ion lowers a compound’s solubility.
- Adding $$H_3O^+$$ (lowering pH) increases an ionic compound’s solubility if the anion of the compound is also that of a weak acid.
- Limestone caves result from shifts in the $$CaCO_3/CO_2$$ equilibrium system.
- When two solutions, each containing one of the ions of a slightly soluble ionic compound, are mixed, an ionic solid forms if $$Q_{sp} > K_{sp}$$.
- Ions are precipitated selectively from a solution of two ionic compounds by adding a precipitating ion until the $$K_{sp}$$ of one compound is exceeded as much as possible without exceeding the $$K_{sp}$$ of the other. An extension of this approach uses simultaneous control of three equilibrium systems to separate metal ions as their sulfides.
- Lakes bounded by limestone-rich soils form buffer systems that prevent acidification.

### Summary of Section 19.4
- A complex ion consists of a central metal ion covalently bonded to two or more negatively charged or neutral ligands. Its formation is characterized by a formation constant, $$K_f$$.
- A hydrated metal ion is a complex ion with water molecules as ligands. Other ligands (stronger Lewis bases) can displace the water molecules and the fully substituted complex ion forms almost completely in the presence of excess ligand.
- Adding a solution containing a ligand increases the solubility of an ionic precipitate if the cation forms a complex ion with the ligand.
- Amphoteric metal hydroxides dissolve in acid and base due to reactions that involve complex ions.

### Summary of Section 20.1
- A change is spontaneous under specified conditions if it occurs without a continuous input of energy.
- Neither the first law of thermodynamics nor the sign of $$ΔH$$ predicts the direction of a spontaneous change.
- Many spontaneous processes involve an increase in the freedom of motion of the system’s particles and, thus, in the dispersal of the system’s energy of motion.
- Entropy is a state function that measures the extent of energy dispersed into the number of microstates possible for a system. Each microstate consists of the quantized energy levels of the system at a given instant.
- The second law of thermodynamics states that, in a spontaneous process, the entropy of the universe (system plus surroundings) increases.
- Absolute entropy values can be determined because perfect crystals have zero entropy at 0 K (third law of thermodynamics).
- Standard molar entropy, $$S°$$ (in $$J/mol⋅K$$), is affected by temperature, phase changes, dissolution, and atomic size or molecular complexity.

### Summary of Section 20.2
- The standard entropy of reaction, $$ΔS°_{rxn}$$, is calculated from $$S°$$ values.
- When the amount (mol) of gas increases in a reaction, usually $$ΔS°_{rxn} > 0$$.
- The change in entropy of the surroundings, $$ΔS_{surr}$$, is related directly to $$−ΔH°_{sys}$$ and inversely to the absolute temperature $$T$$ at which the change occurs.
- In a spontaneous change, the entropy of the system can decrease only if the entropy of the surroundings increases even more, so that $$ΔS_{univ} > 0$$.
- The second law is obeyed in living systems when we consider system plus surroundings.
- For a system at equilibrium, $$ΔS_{univ} = 0$$, so $$ΔS°_{sys} = −ΔS_{surr}$$.
- Even if $$ΔS°_{sys} < 0$$, an exothermic reaction ($$ΔH°_{rxn} < 0$$) is spontaneous ($$ΔS_{univ} > 0$$) if $$ΔS_{surr} >> 0$$; an endothermic reaction ($$ΔH°_{rxn} > 0$$) is spontaneous only if $$ΔS°_{sys} > ΔS_{surr}$$.

### Summary of Section 20.3
- The sign of the free energy change, $$ΔG = ΔH − TΔS$$, is directly related to reaction spontaneity: a negative $$ΔG$$ corresponds to a positive $$ΔS_{univ}$$.
- We use the standard free energy of formation ($$ΔG°_f$$) to calculate $$ΔG°_{rxn}$$ at 298 K.
- The maximum work a system can do is never obtained from a real (irreversible) process because some free energy is always converted to heat.
- The magnitude of $$T$$ influences the spontaneity of a temperature-dependent reaction (same signs of $$ΔH$$ and $$ΔS$$) by affecting the size of $$TΔS$$. For such a reaction, the $$T$$ at which the reaction becomes spontaneous can be found by setting $$ΔG = 0$$.
- A nonspontaneous reaction ($$ΔG > 0$$) can be coupled to a more spontaneous one ($$ΔG << 0$$) to make it occur. For example, in organisms, the hydrolysis of ATP drives many reactions that have a positive $$ΔG$$.

### Summary of Section 20.4
- Two ways of predicting reaction spontaneity are from the sign of $$ΔG$$ or from the value of $$Q/K$$. These variables are related to each other by $$ΔG = RT \ln \left( \frac{Q}{K} \right)$$. When $$Q = K$$, $$\frac{Q}{K} = 1$$ and $$\ln \left( \frac{Q}{K} \right) = 0$$. Thus, the system is at equilibrium and can release (or absorb) no more free energy.
- When $$Q$$ is determined with standard-state values, the free energy change is $$ΔG°$$ and is related to the equilibrium constant: $$ΔG° = -RT \ln K$$.
- Any nonequilibrium mixture of reactants and products moves spontaneously ($$ΔG < 0$$) toward the equilibrium mixture.
- A product-favored reaction goes predominantly toward product and, thus, has $$K > 1$$ and $$ΔG° < 0$$; a reactant-favored reaction has $$K < 1$$ and $$ΔG° > 0$$.

### Summary of Section 21.1
- An oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction involves the transfer of electrons from a reducing agent to an oxidizing agent.
- The half-reaction method of balancing divides the overall reaction into half-reactions that are balanced separately and then recombined.
- There are two types of electrochemical cells. In a voltaic cell, a spontaneous reaction generates electricity and does work on the surroundings. In an electrolytic cell, the surroundings supply electricity that does work to drive a nonspontaneous reaction.
- In both types of cells, two electrodes dip into electrolyte solutions; oxidation occurs at the anode, and reduction occurs at the cathode.

### Summary of Section 21.2
- A voltaic cell consists of oxidation (anode) and reduction (cathode) half-cells, connected by a wire to conduct electrons and a salt bridge to maintain charge neutrality.
- Electrons move from the anode (left) to the cathode (right) while cations move from the salt bridge into the cathode half-cell and anions move from the salt bridge into the anode half-cell.
- The cell notation shows the species and their phases in each half-cell, as well as the direction of current flow.
- A voltaic cell operates because species in the two half-cells differ in the tendency to lose electrons (strength as a reducing agent).

### Summary of Section 21.3
- The output of a voltaic cell is the cell potential ($$E_{cell}$$), measured in volts (1 V = 1 J/C).
- With all substances in their standard states, the output is the standard cell potential ($$E°_{cell}$$).
- $$E°_{cell} > 0$$ for a spontaneous reaction at standard-state conditions.
- By convention, a standard electrode potential ($$E°_{half-cell}$$) refers to the reduction half-reaction.
- $$E°_{cell}$$ equals $$E°_{half-cell}$$ of the cathode minus $$E°_{half-cell}$$ of the anode.
- A standard hydrogen (reference) electrode ($$E°_{reference} = 0 \, \text{V}$$) is used to measure $$E°_{half-cell}$$ values and to rank oxidizing (reducing) agents.
- Spontaneous redox reactions combine stronger oxidizing and reducing agents to form weaker reducing and oxidizing agents, respectively.
- A metal can reduce another species ($$H^+$$, $$H_2O$$, or an ion of another metal) if $$E°_{cell}$$ for the overall reaction is positive.

### Summary of Section 21.4
- A spontaneous process has a negative $$ΔG$$ and a positive $$E_{cell}$$: $$ΔG = -nFE_{cell}$$. The $$ΔG$$ of the cell reaction represents the maximum electrical work the voltaic cell can do.
- The standard free energy change, $$ΔG°$$, is related to $$E°_{cell}$$ and to $$K$$.
- For nonstandard conditions, the Nernst equation shows that $$E_{cell}$$ depends on $$E°_{cell}$$ and a correction term based on $$Q$$. $$E_{cell}$$ is high when $$Q$$ is small (high [reactant]), and it decreases as the cell operates. At equilibrium, $$ΔG$$ and $$E_{cell}$$ are zero, which means that $$Q = K$$.
- Concentration cells have identical half-reactions but solutions of differing concentration. They generate electrical energy as the concentrations become equal.
- Ion-specific electrodes, such as the pH electrode, measure the concentration of one species.
- The principle of the concentration cell—spontaneous movement of ions “down” a concentration gradient—creates an electrical impulse in a nerve cell.

### Summary of Section 21.5
- Batteries are voltaic cells arranged in series and are classified as primary batteries (e.g., alkaline, silver, and lithium), secondary batteries (e.g., lead-acid, nickel–metal hydride, and lithium-ion), or fuel cells.
- Supplying electricity to a rechargeable (secondary) battery reverses the redox reaction, re-forming reactant.
- Fuel cells generate a current through the controlled oxidation of a fuel such as $$H_2$$.

### Summary of Section 21.6
- Corrosion damages metal structures through a natural electrochemical process.
- Iron corrosion occurs in the presence of oxygen and moisture and is increased by high [H+], high [ion], or contact with a less active metal, such as Cu.
- $$Fe$$ is oxidized and $$O_2$$ is reduced in one redox reaction, whereas $$Fe^{2+}$$ is oxidized and $$O_2$$ is reduced to form rust (hydrated form of $$Fe_2O_3$$) in another redox reaction that often takes place at a different location.
- Because $$Fe$$ functions as both anode and cathode in the corrosion process, an iron object can be protected by physically coating it or by joining it to a more active metal (such as $$Zn$$, $$Mg$$, or $$Al$$), which acts as the anode in place of the $$Fe$$.

### Summary of Section 21.7
- An electrolytic cell uses electrical energy to drive a nonspontaneous reaction.
- Oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction at the cathode, but the direction of electron flow and the charges of the electrodes are opposite those in voltaic cells.
- When two products can form at each electrode, the more easily oxidized substance forms at the anode and the more easily reduced substance forms at the cathode.
- Overvoltage causes the actual voltage required to be unexpectedly high (especially for producing gases, such as $$H_2$$ and $$O_2$$) and can affect the product that forms at each electrode.
- The amount of product that forms is proportional to the quantity of charge flowing through the cell, which is related to the time the charge flows and the current.
- Biological redox systems combine aspects of voltaic, concentration, and electrolytic cells to convert bond energy in food into electrochemical potential and then into the bond energy of ATP.

### Summary of Section 22.1
- As the young Earth cooled, the elements became differentiated into a dense, metallic core, a silicate-rich mantle, and a low-density crust.
- High abundances of light metals, metalloids, and nonmetals are concentrated in the crust, which has three regions: lithosphere (solid), hydrosphere (liquid), and atmosphere (gaseous).
- The biosphere (living systems) profoundly affected crustal chemistry by producing free $$O_2$$, and thus an oxidizing environment.
- Some elements occur in their native state, but most are combined in ores. The ores of most important metallic elements are oxides or sulfides.

### Summary of Section 22.2
- The environmental distribution of many elements changes cyclically with time and is affected in major ways by organisms.
- Carbon occurs in all three regions of Earth’s crust, with atmospheric $$CO_2$$ linking the other two regions. Photosynthesis and decomposition of organisms alter the amount of carbon in the land and oceans. Human activity has increased atmospheric $$CO_2$$, leading to climate change.
- Nitrogen is fixed by lightning, by industry, and primarily by microorganisms. When plants or animals decompose, bacteria convert proteins to nitrites and nitrates and eventually to $$N_2$$, which returns to the atmosphere. Through extensive use of fertilizers, humans have added excess nitrogen to freshwaters.
- The phosphorus cycle has no gaseous component. Inorganic phosphates leach slowly into land and water, where biological cycles interact. When plants and animals decompose, they release phosphate to natural waters, where it is then absorbed by other plants and animals. Through overuse of phosphate fertilizers and detergents, humans double the amount of phosphorus entering the aqueous environment.

### Summary of Section 22.3
- Metallurgy involves mining an ore, separating it from debris, pretreating it to concentrate the mineral source, converting the mineral to another compound that is easier to process further, reducing this compound to the metal, purifying the metal, and, in many cases, alloying it to obtain a more useful material.

### Summary of Section 22.4
Production highlights of key elements are as follows:
- $$Na$$ is isolated by electrolysis of molten $$NaCl$$ in the Downs process; $$Cl_2$$ is a byproduct.
- $$K$$ is produced by reduction with $$Na$$ in a thermal process.
- $$Fe$$ is produced through a multistep, high-temperature process in a blast furnace. The crude pig iron is converted to carbon steel in the basic-oxygen process and then alloyed with other metals to make different steels.
- $$Cu$$ is produced by concentration of the ore through flotation, reduction to the metal by smelting, and purification by electrorefining. The metal has extensive electrical and plumbing uses.
- $$Al$$ is extracted from bauxite by pretreating the ore with concentrated base, followed by electrolysis of the product $$Al_2O_3$$ mixed with molten cryolite. $$Al$$ alloys are widely used in homes and industry. The total energy required to extract $$Al$$ from its ore is over 100 times that needed for recycling it.
- The $$Mg^{2+}$$ in seawater is converted to $$Mg(OH)_2$$ and then to $$MgCl_2$$, which is electrolyzed to obtain the metal; $$Mg$$ forms strong, lightweight alloys.
- $$H_2$$ is produced by electrolysis of water or in the formation of gaseous fuels from hydrocarbons. It is used in $$NH_3$$ production, in hydrogenation of vegetable oils, and in energy production. The isotopes of hydrogen differ significantly in atomic mass and thus in the rate at which their bonds to other atoms break (kinetic isotope effect). This difference is used to obtain $$D_2O$$ from water.

### Summary of Section 22.5
- Sulfuric acid production starts with the extraction of sulfur, either by the oxidation of $$H_2S$$ or the mining of sulfur deposits. The sulfur is roasted to $$SO_2$$ and oxidized to $$SO_3$$ by the catalyzed contact process, which optimizes the yield at lower temperatures. Absorption of the $$SO_3$$ into $$H_2SO_4$$, followed by hydration, forms sulfuric acid.
- In the diaphragm-cell method for the chlor-alkali process, aqueous $$NaCl$$ is electrolyzed to form $$Cl_2$$, $$H_2$$, and low-purity $$NaOH$$. The mercury-cell method produces high-purity $$NaOH$$ but has been almost completely phased out because of mercury pollution. The membrane-cell method requires less electricity and does not use $$Hg$$.

### Summary of Section 23.1
- All transition elements are metals.
- Atoms of the d-block elements have $$(n − 1)d$$ orbitals being filled, and their ions have an empty $$ns$$ orbital.
- Unlike the trends for the main-group elements, the atomic size, electronegativity, and first ionization energy change relatively little across a transition series. Because of the lanthanide contraction, atomic size changes little from Period 5 to 6 in a transition metal group; thus, electronegativity, first ionization energy, and density increase down such a group.
- Transition metals typically have several oxidation states, with the $$+2$$ state most common. The elements exhibit less metallic behavior in their higher states, as they have higher valence-state electronegativity.
- Most Period 4 transition metals are active enough to reduce hydrogen ion from acid solution.
- Many transition metal compounds are colored and paramagnetic because the metal ion has unpaired $$d$$ electrons.
- In contrast to main-group metals, transition metals show decreasing reactivity down a group.

### Summary of Section 23.2
- There are two series of inner transition elements. The lanthanides (4f series) have a common $$+3$$ oxidation state and exhibit very similar properties.
- The actinides (5f series) are radioactive. All actinides have a $$+3$$ oxidation state; several, including uranium, have higher states as well.

### Summary of Section 23.3
- Coordination compounds consist of a complex ion and charge-balancing counter ions. The complex ion has a central metal ion bonded to neutral and/or anionic ligands, which have one or more donor atoms that each have a lone pair of electrons.
- The most common complex-ion geometry is octahedral (six ligand atoms bonding).
- Formulas and names of coordination compounds follow systematic rules.
- Coordination compounds can exhibit constitutional isomerism (coordination and linkage) and stereoisomerism (geometric and optical).

### Summary of Section 23.4
- According to valence bond theory, complex ions have coordinate covalent bonds between ligands (Lewis bases) and metal ions (Lewis acids).
- Ligand lone pairs occupy hybridized metal-ion orbitals, leading to the characteristic shapes of complex ions.
- According to crystal field theory, the surrounding field of ligands splits a metal ion’s d-orbital energies. The crystal field splitting energy ($$Δ$$) depends on the charge of the metal ion and the crystal field strength of the ligands.
- $$Δ$$ influences the color (energy of the photons absorbed) and paramagnetism (number of unpaired d electrons) of a complex ion. Strong-field ligands create a large $$Δ$$ and produce low-spin complexes that absorb light of higher energy (shorter wavelength); the reverse is true of weak-field ligands.
- Several transition metals, including iron and zinc, are essential dietary components in trace amounts because they are crucial to the biochemical function of key proteins.

### Summary of Section 24.1
- In dramatic contrast to chemical reactions, nuclear reactions involve particles within the nucleus, usually result in atoms of different elements, are accompanied by measurable changes in mass, and are not affected by temperature, pressure, catalysis, or the nature of the compound.
- To become more stable, a radioactive nuclide may emit $$\alpha$$ particles ($$^{4}_{2}He^{2+}$$; helium-4 nuclei), $$\beta$$ particles ($$\beta^−$$ or $$^{0}_{-1}\beta$$; high-speed electrons), positrons ($$\beta^+$$ or $$^{0}_{1}\beta$$), or $$\gamma$$ rays (high-energy photons) or may capture an orbital electron ($$^{0}_{-1}e$$).
- A narrow band of neutron-to-proton ratios (N/Z) includes those of all the stable nuclides.
- Even values of N and Z are associated with stable nuclides, as are certain “magic numbers” of neutrons and protons.
- By comparing a nuclide’s mass number with the atomic mass and its N/Z ratio with those in the band of stability, we can predict that, in general, neutron-rich nuclides undergo $$\beta^−$$ decay and proton-rich nuclides undergo $$\beta^+$$ emission and/or $$e^−$$ capture. Heavy nuclides (Z > 83) undergo $$\alpha$$ decay.
- Three naturally occurring decay series all end in isotopes of lead.

### Summary of Section 24.2
- Ionization and scintillation counters measure the number of emissions from a radioactive sample.
- The decay rate (activity) of a sample is proportional to the number of radioactive nuclei. Nuclear decay is a first-order process, so the half-life of the process is a constant.
- Radioisotopic methods, such as $$^{14}C$$ dating, determine the age of an object by measuring the ratio of specific isotopes in it.

### Summary of Section 24.3
- One nucleus can be transmuted to another through bombardment with high-energy particles.
- Accelerators increase the kinetic energy of particles in nuclear bombardment experiments and are used to produce transuranium elements and radioisotopes for medical use.

### Summary of Section 24.4
- All radioactive emissions cause ionization.
- The effect of ionizing radiation on living matter depends on the quantity of energy absorbed and the extent of ionization in a given type of tissue. Radiation dose for the human body is measured in rem.
- Ionization forms free radicals, some of which proliferate and destroy biomolecular function.
- All organisms are exposed to varying quantities of natural ionizing radiation.
- Studies show that either a large, acute dose or a chronic, small dose is harmful.

### Summary of Section 24.5
- Radioisotopic tracers have been used to study reaction mechanisms, material flow, elemental composition, and medical conditions.
- Ionizing radiation has been used in devices that destroy cancer tissue, kill organisms that spoil food, control insect populations, and power spacecraft instruments.

### Summary of Section 24.6
- The mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of its nucleons. The energy equivalent to this mass difference is the nuclear binding energy, often expressed in units of MeV.
- The binding energy per nucleon is a measure of nuclide stability and varies with the number of nucleons. Nuclides with $$A \approx 60$$ are most stable.
- Lighter nuclides join (fusion) or heavier nuclides split (fission) to create more stable products.

### Summary of Section 24.7
- In nuclear fission, neutron bombardment causes a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei and to release neutrons that split other nuclei, giving rise to a chain reaction.
- A nuclear power plant controls the rate of the chain reaction to produce heat that creates steam, which is used to generate electricity.
- Potential hazards, such as radiation leaks, thermal pollution, and disposal of nuclear waste, remain current concerns.
- Nuclear fusion holds great promise as a source of clean, abundant energy, but it requires extremely high temperatures and is not yet practical.
- The elements were formed through a complex series of nuclear reactions in evolving stars.
