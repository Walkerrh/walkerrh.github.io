Terence McKenna - I think ideology is toxic, all ideology. It’s not that there are good ones and bad ones. All ideology is toxic, because ideology is a kind of insult to the gift of human free thinking.

Terence McKenna - We have to stop consuming our culture. We have to create culture. Don’t watch TV, don’t read magazines, don’t even listen to NPR. Create your own roadshow. The nexus of space and time, where you are now, is the most immediate sector of your universe. And if you’re worrying about Michael Jackson or Bill Clinton or somebody else, then you are disempowered. You are giving it all away to icons. Icons which are maintained by an electronic media, so that you want to dress like X or have lips like Y. This is sh*t-brained this kind of thinking. That is all cultural diversion. And what is real is you and your friends, and your associations, your highs, your orgasms, your hopes, your plans, your fears. And we are told no. We’re unimportant, we’re peripheral, get a degree, get a job, get a this, get a that, and then you’re a player. You don’t even want to play in that game. You want to reclaim your mind and get it out of the hands of the cultural engineers who want to turn you into a half-baked moron consuming all this trash that’s being manufactured out of the bones of a dying world. Where is that at?

EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 3.2.1–3a - There are three areas in which the person who would be wise and good must be trained. The first has to do with desires and aversions—that a person may never miss the mark in desires nor fall into what repels them. The second has to do with impulses to act and not to act—and more broadly, with duty—that a person may act deliberately for good reasons and not carelessly. The third has to do with freedom from deception and composure and the whole area of judgment, the assent our mind gives to its perceptions. Of these areas, the chief and most urgent is the first which has to do with the passions, for strong emotions arise only when we fail in our desires and aversions.

Emerald Tablet of Heremes (Translation of Issac Newton c. 1680)

Tis true without lying, certain & most true.
That which is below is like that which is above & that which is above is like ye which is below to do ye miracles of one only thing.
And as all things have been & arose from one by ye mediation of one: so all things have their birth from this one thing by adaptation.
The Sun is its father, the moon its mothr,
the wind hath carried it in its belly, the earth its nourse
The father of all perfection in ye whole world is here.
Its force or power is entire if it be converted into earth. (7a) Separate thou ye earth from ye fire, ye subtile from the gross sweetly with great indoustry.
It ascends from ye earth to ye heaven & again it descends to ye earth and receives ye force of things superior & inferior.
By this means you shall have ye glory of ye whole world & thereby all obscurity shall fly from you.
Its force is above all force. For it vanquishes every subtile thing & penetrates every solid thing.
(11a) So was ye world created
From this are & do come admirable adaptations whereof ye means (or process) is here in this.
Hence I am called Hermes Trismegist, having the three parts of ye philosophy of ye whole world.
That which I have said of ye operation of ye Sun is accomplished & ended.
Newton’s work, particularly the laws of motion and universal gravitation, had been used by some people to argue against the existence of God. Newton himself, however, said:

“Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion. God governs all things and knows all that is or can be done.”
“This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent Being. … This Being governs all things, not as the soul of the world, but as Lord over all; and on account of his dominion he is wont to be called ‘Lord God’ [pantokrator], or ‘Universal Ruler’. … The Supreme God is a Being eternal, infinite, absolutely perfect.”
“Opposition to godliness is atheism in profession and idolatry in practice. Atheism is so senseless and odious to mankind that it never had many professors.”
