  - Values include civic patriotism, virtuous citizenship, and property-based personality.
  - Developed during late antiquity and early renaissance.

- **Differences from Early Liberalism**:
  - Rights were seen as products of political society, not granted by God in a pre-social state of nature.

- **Conflict of Interests and Allegiances**:
  - Slavery pitted abolitionist sentiments against free trade economists like Adam Smith.
  - Adam Smith argued in *Wealth of Nations* that people act in their own self-interest, especially in economic matters, leading to economic benefit for all.

- **Arguments for Slavery**:
    - **British slave trader Robert Norris writes in 'A Short Account of the African Slave Trade' (1789)**: The Liberty of Britons to pursue their lawful Occupations should not be forgotten,”nor “the right which every Man in it possesses to carry on his own Business, in the way most advantageous to himself.” 
    - **Samuel Martin writes in 'An Essay Upon Plantership'**: "The labourers of our Colonies have employers, who are not only equally bound by the laws of humanity, as other British subjects, to a tender care of their fellow creatures; but it is also their self-interest (the strongest incitement to human conduct) to preserve them in life and health; and, in case of their death, the same care extends to the support of their children, who are really maintained at a great expense to their owners, till they arrive at maturity of age for labour. Can the poor sons of British liberty boast of all these advantages? The most zealous enthusiasts for the freedom of negroes must answer, NO; if they can be convinced by facts, well-attested facts, by all who have seen, and consider the present state of our colonies"
    - **American Southern planters**: Supported slavery for the growth of the agricultural economy.

- **Adam Smith's View on Slavery**:
  - No friend of slavery.
  - Argued that slave labor, though appearing to cost only maintenance, is the dearest in the end.
  - Believed that a person with no property has no incentive to work beyond their maintenance, leading to violence being the only means to extract more labor.

- **Defense of Slavery**:
  - Defenders denounced Northern and English industrialists for reducing working classes to debt, starvation, and misery.
  - Celebrated slavery as a benevolent, paternalistic system protecting labor from exploitation.

- **Arguments(Abolitionist) Against Slavery**:
  - **Thomas Jefferson**: Described slavery as “a cruel war against human nature” in his first draft of the Declaration of Independence.
  - **Abigail Adams (1774)**: Wished for the abolition of slavery, condemning it as an iniquitous scheme against freedom.
  - **Adam Smit writes in 'Wealth of Nations'(1776)**: "The experience of all ages and nations, demonstrates that the work done by slaves, though it appears to cost only their maintenance, is in the end the dearest of any. A person who can acquire no property, can have no other interest but to eat as much, and to labour as little as possible. Whatever work he does beyond what is sufficient to purchase his own maintenance, can be squeezed out of him by violence only and not by any interest of his own.”
