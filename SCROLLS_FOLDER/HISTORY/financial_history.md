  - Previously issued only during times of great need (e.g., Second Punic War, campaign of Lucius Cornelius Sulla).
  - Scarcity of gold mines in Europe, except in Wales, Transylvania, and Spain.
  - Most gold supplies secured from the east, requiring a large, expensive army engaged in constant conflict.

- **Coinage**:
  - Gold coin: aureus.
  - Silver denarius and various copper coins: sestertius, dupondius, and as.

- **Constantine's Tithe**:
  - Emperor Constantine decreed a tax: 1/10 of all income tithed to the Christian Church.
  - Hastened the destruction of the empire.

- **Concentration of Wealth**:
  - Church eventually held one third to one half of all lands and accumulated vast wealth.
  - Concentration of wealth produced a scarcity of coinage.
  - Lack of circulation or distribution of goods and services.

- **Use of Tithes**:
  - Tithes were not recycled through community investment or charitable works.
  - Vast hoards of gold were concentrated in Constantinople and the Vatican fortress in Rome.

- **Economic Ruination**:
  - The Roman Empire became a parasitic organism in the fifth and sixth centuries.
  - Experienced alternating phases of inflation and deflation.
  - No industrial production, almost all food imported, and unprecedented scale of usury.

  - Commerce stagnated.
  - Arts and science were lost, and cement-making knowledge disappeared.

- **Factors in the Decline**:
  - Concentration of wealth.
  - Absence of mining deposits for industrial production.
  - Importation of non-White slaves and degradation of the genetic value of the nation.
  - By the 4th century AD, slaves outnumbered citizens by five to one due to decline in Roman female fertility.
  - Inadequate supply of inexpensive circulating medium of money.
  - False notion that money should be a commodity.

- **Economic Lessons**:
  - A dishonest economic system will inevitably contribute to societal dissolution.
  - No society can survive a false economic system.
  - For a society to function and prosper, the means of exchange must be issued free of debt and interest by the legal authority of the state, representing the people in perpetuity.

# The Hidden Origins of the Bank of England

> ...all great events have been distorted, most of the important causes concealed...If the history of England is ever written by one who has the knowledge and the courage, the world would be astonished.
> - Benjamin Disraeli, Prime Minister of Great Britain

## Ancient England

### King Offa of Mercia (757-791 AD)
- Ruled the Kingdom of Mercia, bounded by the rivers Trent and Mersey in the north, the Thames Valley in the south, Wales in the west, and East Anglia and Essex in the east.
- Mercia was one of the seven autonomous kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy.
- Offa was a wise administrator and a kind-hearted leader.

### First Monetary System in England
- Due to scarcity of gold, Offa used silver for coinage and as a store of wealth.
- Standard unit of exchange was a pound of silver divided into 240 pennies.
- Pennies were stamped with a star (Old English "stearra"), from which the word "sterling" is derived.

### Laws Against Usury
- 787 AD: Offa introduced a statute prohibiting usury (charging interest on money lent).
- King Alfred (865-899 AD): Further entrenched laws against usury, directing forfeiture of usurers' property.
- Edward the Confessor (1042-1066 AD): Decreed forfeiture and declared usurers as outlaws, banishing them for life.

## First Jewish Migration and Expulsion

### Arrival in England (1066)
- Jews arrived in England following William I's defeat of King Harold II at Hastings on October 14, 1066.
- These Jews came from Rouen, Normandy, and possibly financed the invasion.
- For their support, they were allowed to practice usury under royal protection.

### Economic Impact
- Interest rates charged: 33% per annum on lands mortgaged by nobles, 300% per annum on tools of trade or chattels pledged by workmen.
- By 1186, one quarter of all English lands were in the hands of Jewish usurers.
- Aaron of Lincoln, at his death in 1186, was declared the richest man in England, with wealth exceeding that of King Henry II.

### Jewish Practices
- Jews undermined guilds and exasperated English merchants by selling a variety of goods under one roof.
- They were involved in clipping silver coins, melting them into bullion, and plating tin with silver.

### Government Response
- Dr. William Cunningham compared the activity of Jews in England to a sponge, hindering economic development.
- The government attempted to integrate Jews into decent trades and honest work without success.

### Rising Tensions and Taxes
- By the 13th century, many nobles faced losing their lands through usury and taxation.
- In 1207, an enormous sum of £60,000 was levied in taxes on the Christian population, while Jews paid lower taxes on understated income.

### Magna Carta (1215)
- Nobles revolted and forced King John to sign the Magna Carta on June 15, 1215.
- The Magna Carta aimed to cancel the bonds of Jewish moneylenders, abolish usury, and end the privileged position of Jews.

- Any Jew remaining after November 1, 1290 (All Saints Day), was liable to be executed.

## The Glorious Middle Ages

### Abolition of Usury
- With the banishment of moneylenders and abolition of usury, taxes were moderate and there was no state debt.
- Interest-free tally stick was used for government expenditures.

### Tally Stick System
- Derived from the Latin word "tallia" meaning a stick.
- Made out of hazel, willow, or boxwood, usually eight inches long and half an inch wide.
- Denominations indicated by different sized cuts in the wood.
- Payee recorded on the flat sides; tally split nearly to the bottom to create a counter tally (held at the Exchequer) and a flat strip given to the payee.

### Introduction and Use of Tally Sticks
- Introduced during the reign of King Henry II (1100-1135).
- Remained in circulation until 1783.
- Reached their apogee between 1290-1485, becoming the principal means of state finance.

## Second Jewish Migration

### The Protector and Immigration Conference
- **7-18 December 1655**: Oliver Cromwell, known as The Protector, held a conference in Whitehall, London, to obtain approval for the large-scale immigration of Jews.
- Despite the conference being packed with Cromwell's supporters, the overwhelming consensus was against permitting Jews to enter England.

### Surreptitious Arrival of Jews
- **October 1656**: First Jews were allowed to land in England despite strong protests from the sub-committee of the Council of State.
- Merchants and other delegates spoke against the admission of Jews, fearing moral harm to the state and enrichment of foreigners at the expense of the English.

### Governance Changes and Financial Impacts
- **1 August 1663**: Charles II passed the Act for the Encouragement of Trade, allowing the export of foreign coins or bullion of gold or silver without regulation or duties.
  - Earl of Anglesey warned this could allow rich individuals to control the nation's coin and bullion, leading to economic instability.

### Private Minting of Coins
- Three years later, the Act for the Encouragement of Coinage permitted bankers and goldsmiths to mint coins at the Royal Mint.
  - Allowed them to benefit from seigniorage and manipulate the money supply, causing economic detriment to the general population.

### Overthrow of James II
- **Reign of James II (1685-1688)**: Short-lived due to propaganda from Holland and military expedition by Prince William of Orange.

- A.N. Field in *All these Things* describes the events known as the Glorious Revolution of 1688:
  - Dutch Prince William of Orange, backed by Jewish financiers, overthrew James II.
  - Establishment of the Bank of England led to Britain accumulating a National Debt.
  - Shakespeare’s *Richard II* is quoted to describe England’s fall into debt and shame.

> "This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,  
> Dear for her reputation through the world,  
> Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,  
> Like to a tenement or pelting farm:  
> England, bound in with the triumphant sea  
> Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege  
> Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,  
> With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:  
> That England, that was wont to conquer others,  
> Hath made a shameful conquest of itself."  
> - Richard II Act II Scene 1

- The history of the second Jewish settlement in Britain is marked by increasing national debt and the ascent of Jews in the nation’s affairs.


## Establishment of the Bank of England

### Proposal and Foundation
- **1693**: Retired pirate William Paterson wrote a pamphlet, *A Brief Account of the Intended Bank of England*.
  - Claimed the Bank “hath the benefit of interest on all moneys which it creates out of nothing.”
- **21 June 1694**: Subscription lists for the Bank with a capital of £1,200,000 were opened and fully subscribed by the following Monday.

### Purpose and Operations
- Ostensible purpose: Lend King William unlimited sums at 8% per annum for wars, particularly against Louis XIV of France.
  - Bank received £100,000 per annum in interest, plus £4,000 administrative fee.
  - Right to issue £1,200,000 in bank notes without any gold cover.

### Hidden Agenda and Opposition
- Byelaws scrutinized by Serjeant-at-Law Creswell Levinz to ensure the Bank's hidden purpose of creating money out of nothing at interest.
  - Levinz was a crypto-Jew who practiced as an advocate and later served as a judge.
- Opposition from goldsmiths, moneylenders, landowners, and country gentry fearing interest rate escalation and economic manipulation.

### Parliamentary Approval
- Formation of the Bank passed by an Act of Parliament titled “An Act for granting to theire Majesties severall Rates and Duties upon Tunnage of Shipps and Vessells...”
- House of Commons: 514 members (243 Tories, 241 Whigs, 28 unknown allegiance).
  - Approximately 20% of members were illiterate.
- **27 July 1694**: Charter of Incorporation granted with only 42 Whig members present, all voting in favor.

### Bill Details and Hidden Purpose
- Title of the bill made no mention of the proposed Bank of England.
- Bill's opening sentence: “William and Mary by the grace of God, King and Queen of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, defenders of the faith etc. To all for whom these presents shall come greeting.”
- Third sentence (242 words): Detailed necessity to levy new rates, duties, and taxes on ships, beer, ale, and other liquors to fund interest on future government loans.

### Introduction of New Taxes
- Additional taxes introduced to fund government loan interest:
  - Land tax, paper tax, poll tax, salt tax, stamp tax, window tax (replaced hearth or chimney tax).
  - Taxes on pedlars, hackney coaches, births, marriages, and deaths, and bachelors.
  - Most punitive: income tax levied at 20% on companies and laborers.

> "The history of the second Jewish settlement in Britain is one long trail of parchment bonds shackling the nation in debt. Every step in the ascent of the Jew in the nation’s affairs has been marked by the increase and multiplication of debt."


## War and Debt Slavery in Perpetuity

### Pattern of Unnecessary Wars
- Wars increased national debt and usurers' profits.
- Wars often targeted countries with interest-free state banking systems:
  - North American colonies
  - France under Napoléon
  - Imperial Russia in WWI
  - Germany, Italy, and Japan in WWII
  - Libya in 2011

### Bank of England's Early Operations

- **1 May 1707**: Union between Scotland and England, motivated by seizing control of the Royal Mint in Edinburgh (1709).

### Rising National Debt
- **1720**: National debt rose to £30 million after the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714), costing £50 million.
- **1775-1783**: American War of Independence led to national debt soaring to £176 million.
  - Colonists replaced debt-free colonial scrip with English money, resulting in 50% unemployment.

### Ownership of the Bank
- **1722**: Majority of Bank of England shares acquired by Sephardic Jews: Solomon de Medina, da Costas, Fonseca, Henriquez, Mendez, Nuñes, Rodriguez, Salvador, and Teixeira de Mattos.

### Attempts to Abolish National Debt
- **1786**: Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger introduced a sinking fund to repay the debt, soon abandoned due to war against Napoléon.
- **1797**: Graduated income tax introduced to pay for the burgeoning interest burden, yielding £70 million per annum by 1815.

### Wars Against France and the U.S.
- **1792-1815**: War against France aimed to destroy Napoléon's debt- and interest-free financial system.
- **1812-1814**: War against the U.S. instigated by banker Mayer Amschel Rothschild after U.S. Congress refused to renew the charter of the Rothschild-controlled Bank of the United States.
  - Prime Minister Spencer Perceval tried to stop the war but was assassinated on 11 May 1812.

### Ballooning National Debt
- **1815**: National debt ballooned to £885 million.
  - War against Napoléon cost the British public £831 million, with over £2.5 billion still outstanding in 1914.
  - Principal of £504 million increased fivefold due to compounding interest.

### Observations by William Cobbett
- William Cobbett (1763-1835): "The investors knew what they were about. Their design was to mortgage by degrees the whole country... The scheme has produced what the world never saw before - starvation in the midst of abundance."

### Failed Attempts to Nationalize the Bank
- **1800**: Sir William Pultney proposed a national bank.
- **1824**: David Ricardo submitted a detailed plan to convert the Bank of England into a national bank.
- Both attempts failed.

### Increasing National Debt Through Wars
- **1914**: Start of WWI, national debt at £650 million.
- **1919**: National debt increased to £7.434 billion.
  - £3 billion still outstanding after 95 years at 3.5% interest per annum.
  - 40% of the 1919 budget allocated to interest payments.
- **WWII**: National debt rose from £7.1 billion in 1939 to £20.1 billion in 1945.
- **March 2017**: National debt over £1.8 trillion.
  - Including all liabilities, it exceeds £5 trillion.


## Nationalisation

### Nationalisation of the Bank
- **14 February 1946**: The Labour government nationalised the Bank of England.
  - Shareholders received Treasury Notes valued at £11,015,100, redeemable after 20 years.

### Nature of Nationalisation
- Nationalisation did not change the privately run system of fractional reserve banking.
- Undertaken primarily for propaganda purposes as part of the Labour Party’s nationalisation programme of financial and industrial concerns.

### Establishment of Bank of England Nominees Limited
- **6 April 1974**: Bank of England established Bank of England Nominees Limited (company registration No. 1307478), a wholly-owned subsidiary.
  - Private shareholders held its 100 £1 shares, with 50% sold.
- Suspicions arose that this was a reverse takeover by private shareholders.

### Lack of Transparency
- Certain aspects of the Bank of England’s operations are protected by its Royal Charter, Section 27(9) of the Companies Act of 1976, and the Official Secrets Act of 1989.
- These protections exempt the Bank from public and parliamentary scrutiny, adding credibility to allegations of a reverse takeover.

- **Principles**:
  - Loans should not be used for current expenditure, whether civil or military.

### Legacy and Achievements
- Napoléon’s reforms led to prosperity, progress, and the dissemination of new ideas.
- Established educational institutions, specialized schools, and professional schools for various sciences.
- Described his public works and code of laws as his most enduring monument.

> "I inspired France and Europe with new ideas which will never be forgotten....France’s finances are the best in the world. To whom does she owe them? If I had not been overthrown I would have made a complete change in the appearance of commerce as well as of industry. The efforts of the French people were extraordinary. Prosperity and progress were growing immeasurably. Enlightenment was making giant strides. New ideas were everywhere heard and published, for I took pains to introduce science among the people....If I had been given time there would soon have been no more artisans in France; they would all have become artists."





# A Century of Struggle: Rothschild versus the People

## The Bank's Foreign Ownership
- The press described the central bank bill with strong negative terms: “a great swindle,” “a vulture,” “a viper,” and “a cobra.”
- There was significant contention that it was the constitutional right of Congress to regulate weights and measures and issue coined money.
- The bill was narrowly defeated by a vote of 65 to 64, an achievement considering many yes votes were likely bought.
- On 3 March 1811, the First Bank of the United States officially closed its doors.

## Mayer Amschel Rothschild's Reaction
- Upon learning about the deep dissension regarding the renewal of the bank’s charter, Rothschild became enraged, declaring: “Either the application for renewal of the charter is granted, or the United States will find itself involved in a most disastrous war.”
- Rothschild further threatened: “I will teach those impudent Americans a lesson and bring them back to colonial status.”
- Rothschild attempted to influence British Prime Minister Spencer Perceval into declaring war on the United States to resurrect his privately owned central bank.

## Spencer Perceval's Assassination
- Perceval joined the cabinet as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1807, raising money to finance the war with France through loans from Barings Bank and predominantly from the Rothschilds.
- John Charles Herries, Perceval’s secretary, had close ties with Nathan Rothschild and served the Rothschild cause in various government positions until his death in 1858.
- Rothschild agents provocateurs stoked discontent in North America. The British interfered with US trade with France and engaged in impressment of American sailors, while supplying arms to Indian tribes like the Shawnee, frustrating American westward expansion.
- On 11 May 1812, John Bellingham, an aggrieved man with connections to American merchants Thomas Wilson and Elisha Peck, assassinated Perceval in the lobby of the House of Commons.
- Bellingham was tried and hanged on 18 May 1812, with the trial and execution expedited to prevent untoward disclosures.

## War of 1812
- In the United States, Henry Clay led the “War Hawks” in the House of Representatives to declare war on Britain on 1 June 1812, decided by a vote of 79 to 49.
- The Senate voted 19 to 13 for war, with all 39 Federalists refusing to support it, leading critics to refer to it as “Mr Madison’s War.”
- In England, Perceval’s successor, Lord Robert Liverpool, supported the war.
- The war led to the establishment of the Second Bank of the United States on 10 April 1816, with an enlarged capital of $35 million.
- Nicholas Biddle, who had connections with the Rothschilds, became the bank’s president in 1822.

## Andrew Jackson's Opposition
- Jackson campaigned against the central bank, calling it a “monster” and using the slogan “VOTE ANDREW JACKSON – NO BANK.”
- Jackson survived an assassination attempt by Richard Lawrence on 30 January 1835.
- In 1836, Jackson dismantled the bank by withdrawing all government deposits and repaid the National Debt, leaving a surplus of $50 million in the Treasury.
- The central bank was replaced by an Independent Treasury System based on redeemable paper and specie.

## President John Tyler's Term
- During Tyler’s term (1841-45), Congress attempted twice to renew the Bank's charter, sponsored by Henry Clay, under the influence of the Rothschilds.
- Tyler vetoed both bills and received hundreds of assassination threats.
- For 77 years, the U.S. operated without a central bank, using debt and interest-free Treasury “greenback” dollar bills and gold and silver coins.

## Abraham Lincoln's Greenbacks
- In 1862, President Lincoln issued $347 million in greenbacks to finance the Civil War, rejecting high-interest loans from private bankers.
- Lincoln’s defiance of the Rothschilds resulted in his assassination on 15 April 1865 by John Wilkes Booth, at the behest of Rothschild’s agent Rothberg.
- The American Civil War left the U.S. government with a war debt of $5 billion.
- In the 1868 presidential election, Rothschild’s agent August Belmont influenced the outcome to ensure the repayment of bonds in gold, leading to a 100% profit for the Rothschilds.

## Demonetisation of Silver
- In 1873, the U.S. replaced silver with a gold standard, known as the “Crime of 1873,” orchestrated by the Bank of England and involving bribes to U.S. Congress members.
- The German Empire also ceased minting silver thaler coins in 1871, part of a coordinated scheme by the Rothschilds to entrench the gold standard.
- The gold standard enabled private bankers to control the money supply, leading to a series of bank runs and panics from 1873 to 1907.

## President James Abram Garfield's Assassination
- Garfield intended to address the banking problem but was assassinated on 2 July 1881, shortly after expressing his intentions.
- The 1907 panic, the worst of its kind, was instigated by JP Morgan by circulating insolvency rumors about the Knickerbocker Bank, leading to significant economic fallout.
- These continual boom and bust cycles provided the pretext to establish a central bank, leading to the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913.




## Establishment of the United States Federal Reserve Bank

### Two “Alternative” Plans
- The Aldrich Plan by the National Monetary Commission, led by Senator Nelson Aldrich.
- The Wall Street Plan by the Special Currency Committee of the New York Chamber of Commerce, chaired by Paul Warburg.
- Both plans aimed to establish a central reserve bank and were nearly identical except for the distribution of reserves.

### The Secret Meeting at Jekyll Island
- On 22 November 1910, banking conspirators secretly traveled to Jekyll Island, Georgia.
  - Participants included A. Piatt Andrew (Assistant Secretary of the Treasury), Frank Vanderlip (president of the National City Bank of New York), Henry P. Davidson (senior partner JP Morgan and Company), Charles D. Norton (president First National Bank of New York), Benjamin Strong (vice president Bankers Trust of New York), and Paul Warburg (partner Kuhn, Loeb & Company).
  - The meeting took place at the Jekyll Island Hunt Club owned by JP Morgan.
  - They used first names only to conceal their identities from the staff.

### Opposition to the Bill
- Congressman Charles August Lindbergh vehemently opposed the bill to establish the Federal Reserve:
  - He claimed it established “the most gigantic trust on earth” and legalized the “invisible government by the money power.”
- Senator Robert M. La Follette was one of the bill’s most vociferous opponents.
  - The bill passed into law on 23 December 1913 after President Woodrow Wilson threatened to keep the Senate in session until it passed.

### Passage of the Bill
- The bill was supported by a minority of 43 Senators, with 25 voting against, 27 refusing to vote, and 5 absent.
  - Promoters promised a stable dollar and an end to business cycles and recessions.

### Consequences of the Federal Reserve
- Since the inception of the Federal Reserve in 1914:
  - The US dollar has lost 97% of its purchasing power.
  - There have been 19 recessions, the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the current Great Recession starting in 2008.
  - The National Debt increased from $2.65 billion in 1910 to $20 trillion in March 2017.
  - Unfunded liabilities exceed $240 trillion, including social security, Medicare, and benefits for military veterans.

### Role and Control of the Federal Reserve
- The Federal Reserve has operated as a private bank for the benefit of private bankers, never submitting its accounts to public audit.
  - Principal shareholders include Rothschild Banks of London and Berlin, Lazard Brothers Banks of Paris, Israel Moses Sieff Banks of Italy, Warburg Bank of Hamburg and Amsterdam, Shearson American Express, Goldman Sachs of New York, and JP Morgan Chase Bank.



## The State Bank of the Russian Empire

### Establishment and Early Years
- The Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) aimed to settle issues from the French Revolutionary Wars, the Napoleonic Wars, and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire.
- Nathan Mayer Rothschild proposed a new world order centered around central banking. Tsar Alexander I of Russia refused to comply.
- Instead, Tsar Alexander I formed The Holy Alliance between Austria, Prussia, and Russia, signed on 26 September 1815.
- The State Bank of the Russian Empire was founded on 12 June 1860, aiming to boost trade turnovers and strengthen the monetary system.
- Initially an auxiliary institution under the Ministry of Finance, it became the banker of the bankers in 1894, minting and printing the nation's coins and notes.

### Economic Impact
- Russia had the largest gold reserves in the world, exceeding its bank note issue by more than 100%, except in 1906.
- By 1914, it was one of the most influential lending institutions in Europe, with the smallest national debt in the world.

- Social insurance was introduced in 1912, and labor laws were so advanced that President William Taft of the United States praised them.

### Conclusion
- Tsar Nicholas II and the State Bank of the Russian Empire created unparalleled prosperity and social benefits.
- On 17 November 1917, the Rothschilds instigated and financed the Judeo-Bolshevik revolution in Russia, which destroyed this prosperity and led to the deaths of millions.





## The Creation and Control of the Soviet Union

In "Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution," author Professor Antony Sutton, with the assistance of State Department documents and personal papers of American international bankers, details the “enthusiastic alliance of Wall Street and Marxist Socialism.” Without the financial support of J.P. Morgan’s Guaranty Trust Company, John D. Rockefeller’s Chase National Bank, Jacob Schiff’s Kuhn Loeb and Company, and Olof Aschberg of the Swedish Nya Banken, the Judeo-Bolshevik revolution would not have succeeded. Of particular interest in the financing of the revolution is the role which Maxim Litvinov (1876-1951), born Meyer-Genokh Mojsjewicz Wallach-Finkelstein, played in destroying Imperial Russia and handing it over to the international bankers.

### Litvinov's Revolutionary Career
- Litvinov started his revolutionary career in 1898.
- Arrested in 1901, he spent 18 months in prison before escaping.
- In 1903, he was entrusted with money to finance and distribute the Russian Socialist Democratic Party's newspaper, Iskra, printed in London.
- In 1905, Litvinov received more funds from “friends from abroad” to purchase arms in London.
- Known as "Papasha" or "Daddy," Litvinov became the treasurer of the party, a decision Lenin could not overrule.

### Litvinov in London
- From 1908-1918, Litvinov resided in London with the assistance of his “English friends.”
- During this period, he held various occupations to cover his clandestine activities.
- Married Ivy Low, a daughter of a distinguished Jewish family in England, in 1916.
- On 3 January 1918, Litvinov was appointed as the authorized representative of Soviet Russia and demanded the money held at the Bank of England for the Tsarist embassy, which was handed over to him.

### Litvinov's Role in Soviet Russia
- In September 1918, after a conspiracy involving British ambassador Robert Bruce Lockhart was exposed, Litvinov returned to Moscow.
- Tasked with securing the outflow of gold and jewelry from Russia via Scandinavia.
- By April 1921, appointed Commissioner of the Council of People’s Commissars for currency transactions and sales of gold abroad.
- Sold large amounts of Russian gold directly or through intermediaries to large French companies and eventually to the American Reserve Bank, owned by the Rothschilds.

### Economic Impact
- The Kuzbass Autonomous Industrial Colony was established in December 1921, handing control of a vast industrial complex to American and European investors.
- Millions of gold rubles flowed abroad allegedly as interest for capital invested by European bankers.
- Despite the 1937-1938 purge, Litvinov remained pre-eminent, feared by no one including Stalin.
- Litvinov served as People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs from 1930-1939.

### Relations with Nazi Germany and Litvinov's Dismissal
- In 1939, relations between National Socialist Germany and the Soviet Union started to thaw, which was anathema to Litvinov’s masters.
- Stalin dismissed Litvinov on 3 May 1939, signaling a quiet coup d’état.
- The Soviet Union gained sovereignty and independence from the international bankers with its own State Bank of the USSR (Gosbank) founded on 16 November 1921.

### Litvinov's Later Years
- During World War II, Litvinov secured a loan of one billion dollars from the United States and a Lend-Lease agreement worth $11 billion.
- Recalled in 1943, his successor Vyacheslav Molotov condemned him as utterly hostile to the Soviet Union.
- The Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 established a World Bank and an International Monetary Fund, which the Soviet representatives refused to sign, calling them “branches of Wall Street.”

### The Cold War and Beyond
- The Potsdam Conference in 1945 marked the start of the Cold War.
- Stalin resisted Western pressure and was allegedly poisoned in 1953.
- Despite massive investments by the West in Soviet industries, the Soviet Union could not match Western living standards due to high military expenditures.
- The Soviet Union imploded in 1991, leading to the introduction of unregulated free-market capitalism and the eventual control of Russia by the Rothschilds.

### Conclusion
The financial and political maneuvers by the Rothschilds and their agents significantly influenced the course of Russian history, from the Bolshevik Revolution to the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union and the integration of Russia into the global financial system dominated by the Rothschilds.



## Rothschilds’ Responsibility for the Anglo-Boer War

### Discovery and Control of Goldfields
- The discovery of the largest goldfields in the world on the Witwatersrand in 1886 created a new source of supply which needed to be controlled to maintain the existing monetary system, dominated by the Rothschilds. Unfortunately for them, these mines were located in the independent Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek.
- Streams of immigrants and speculators, including many Russian, Polish, and German Jews, soon arrived in the country. The gold mine owners were almost entirely Jewish, with the leading company being the Eckstein group. 
- Professor John Atkinson Hobson noted that Rothschild had a controlling interest in various companies and significant influence over the Stock Exchange and press in Johannesburg.

### Political Agitation and Conflict
- In 1896, after the abortive Jameson Raid, the South African League was founded as a Rothschild front to agitate for the granting of voting rights to the uitlanders or foreigners. 
- The Boers would only grant the franchise after 14 years of residence. 
- On 30 May 1899, at a conference held in Bloemfontein, President Paul Krüger offered to reduce the period of residence for voting rights to seven years. The British High Commissioner, Sir Alfred Milner, refused the compromise, insisting on “reform or war.” Krüger, in anguish, cried out, “It is my country that you want!”

### Outbreak of War
- In September 1899, the British began massing troops on the southern Transvaal border. 
- On 9 October 1899, the Transvaal government requested that Her Majesty’s government cease the buildup of troops. 
- This request was ignored, and war broke out two days later on 11 October 1899.
- Although the Boers had only a part-time army of mounted horsemen, they enjoyed initial successes in the war. 
- From June 1900 onwards, the Boers resorted to guerrilla warfare, frustrating and tying down almost 450,000 British troops with their force of never more than 6,000 active Boers.

### Aftermath and Consequences
- Peace was signed at Vereeniging on 31 May 1902, marking the end of the war. 
- The war had been a disaster for the Boers, with an unprecedented scorched earth policy being introduced by the British. 
- Boer homesteads were razed, wells were poisoned, cattle were slaughtered, and women were raped. 
- 155,000 women and children were herded into 46 concentration camps, where 34,000 died due to malnutrition, poor sanitation, and exposure.
- The British also suffered high losses, with 21,942 being killed (35% in battle, 65% from disease) and 22,829 being wounded.
- The bankers had the satisfaction of obtaining full control of the gold and other mineral resources of South Africa, financing the war in the amount of £222 million and thereby adding a further £132 million to Britain’s national debt.
- For Nathan, Alfred, and Leopold Rothschild, the Anglo-Boer War was a consummate victory.


## The Commonwealth Bank of Australia

### Establishment and Early Success
- The Commonwealth Bank of Australia was inspired by King O’Malley, an American who learned the secrets of fractional reserve banking while working for his uncle’s bank in New York in the 1880s.
- When the bank’s first governor, Sir Dennison Miller, was asked where he proposed obtaining capital for his bank, he replied, “What capital? I don’t need any capital, my capital is the entire wealth and credit of the whole of Australia.”
- With an advance of £10,000 from the government, which was quickly repaid, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia was founded on 15 July 1912.
- Although established as a private bank, it operated as a state bank with the power to carry on all business generally transacted by banks, including that of a savings bank. It could raise capital through the sale of debentures secured by the national credit.
- Its profits were divided equally into a reserve fund to meet any liabilities incurred by the bank and a redemption fund to redeem debentures or other stock issued by the bank. Thereafter, 50% of its profits were allocated for the liquidation of the National Debt.
- For the next 12 years, despite the years of World War I (1914-18), Australia enjoyed one of its greatest eras of prosperity.

### Contributions to Infrastructure and Economy
- By providing government loans at a nominal rate of interest, ⅔ of one percent per annum, it enabled the country to embark on a massive infrastructure program.
- Projects included the construction of dams and the Murrumbidgee irrigation system, the great Transcontinental Railroad, electricity power plants, gasworks, harbors, roads, and tramways.
- The bank financed the fruit, wheat, and wool crops of farmers for an amount of A$3 million at nominal rates of interest.
- It made available A$4 million to purchase 15 cargo steamers to transport Australia’s growing exports and A$8 million were allocated to subsidized housing.
- World War I cost Australia A$700 million, but it was financed by the bank as a non-interest-bearing debt.

### Decline and Loss of Independence
- This period of prosperity ended in 1924 when a bill, introduced by Prime Minister Stanley Melbourne Bruce and Dr. Earle Page, placed control of the bank in the hands of a directorate consisting of a Governor, the Secretary to the Treasury, and six persons engaged in agriculture, finance, and industry.
- During Bruce’s term of office, the Australian government borrowed £230 million from the City of London, and by 1927 the federal and state debt had reached £1 billion, with the budget in deficit.
- On 10 October 1924, the bill was proclaimed as an Act, placing the bank under the control of a body of men who later deprived it of the right to create the nation’s money supply free of debt and interest.
- In 1927, the bank lost its savings bank subsidiary, and although it was allowed to continue issuing banknotes and earn some seigniorage, it thereafter became a central bank operating exclusively for the benefit of private banks.
- The final betrayal occurred on 20 March 1947 when the House of Representatives voted for the bank to become a member of the International Monetary Fund, subjecting it to the decrees and dictates of the Rothschild-controlled Bank for International Settlements.



## World War I

### Outbreak of War
- World War I started on 28 June 1914 when Gavrilo Princip, allegedly of Jewish origin and a member of a terrorist group, the Black Hand, assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austrian throne, and his wife at Sarajevo, Bosnia Herzegovina.
- Princip was a collaborator of Leon Trotsky (Lev Davidovitsj Bronstein), a Russian Jew conspiring with Vladimir Lenin (real name Zederbaum) to overthrow the Russian monarchy. 
- Trotsky and Lenin were financed by American Jew Jacob Schiff, a front man for English Jew Lord Nathan Rothschild, one of the masterminds behind the war.

### Influence of International Jewish Bankers
- The United States Senate in 1921 recorded that “Full responsibility for the First World War lies on the shoulders of the International Jewish Bankers. They are responsible for Millions of dead and dying.”
- Henry Ford identified the international Jewish bankers as the instigators of World War I, expressing his views in "The International Jew" published by the Dearborn Independent newspaper.
- In October 1926, British parliamentarian Victor H. Cazalet and Henry Ford discussed the role of international Jewish financiers in causing wars for profit.

### Causes of World War I
1. To destroy the Russian Empire and its State Bank.
2. To break up the other empires (Austro-Hungarian, German, and Ottoman) into smaller states for easier exploitation through central banks.
3. The theft of Palestine and the creation of a Zionist puppet state under Rothschild control.

### Turning Points and U.S. Involvement
- By the end of 1916, the British and French armies were in danger of losing the war.
- The British had lost their naval supremacy at the Battle of Jutland on 3 May 1916.
- Lord Rothschild offered to secure American intervention in return for Palestine, resulting in the U.S. declaring war on Germany on 6 April 1917.
- On 2 November 1917, the Balfour Declaration, drafted by Lord Arthur James Balfour and General Jan Christian Smuts, promised Palestine to Jewish settlers.

### Consequences and Aftermath
- The war continued for another two years, resulting in the destruction of Russia and creating an insoluble problem in the Middle East.
- Rabbi Reichorn in 1859 stated, “Wars are the Jews’ harvest, for with them, we wipe out the Christians and get control of their gold.”
- Mayer Amschel Rothschild’s wife, Gutle Schnapper, said before she died in 1849, “If my sons did not want war, there would have been none.”
- An armistice was declared on 11 November 1918, and the Treaty of Versailles was signed on 28 June 1919, placing exclusive blame on Germany and demanding reparations of £6.6 billion.
- General Smuts remarked, “Everything we have done here is far worse than the Congress of Vienna. The statesmen of 1815 at least knew what was going on. Our statesmen have no idea.”



# The Great Depression

> Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, addressed the United States Bankers’ Association on 26 August 1924, stating the need for capital protection and the role of central banks in governing through financial control. He emphasized the importance of maintaining debts and foreclosures to control the populace and influence political systems.

### Central Banks in the Early 20th Century
- In 1922, a conference in Genoa, attended by heads of state and central bankers, resolved to establish central banks in all countries. Montagu Norman insisted that these banks be independent of their governments.
- By the turn of the twentieth century, only 18 central banks existed worldwide, including the:
  - Swedish  Riksbank  (1668)
  - Bank  of  England  (1694)
  - Banco  de  Espana (1782)
  - Banque  de  France  (1800) 
  - Bank  of  Finland  (1812) 
  - De Nederlandsche  Bank[200]  (1814)
  - Norges  Bank  (1816)
  - Österreichische Nationalbank (1816)
  - Danmarks Nationalbank (1818) 
  - Banco de Portugal (1846)
  - National Bank of Belgium (1850) 
  - Bank Indonesia (formerly Java Bank) (1828)
  - German Reichsbank (1876)
  - Bulgarian National Bank (1879)
  - National Bank of Romania (1880)
  - Bank of Japan (1882)
  - National Bank of Serbia (1884)
  - the Banca d’Italia (1893)

### The Bank for International Settlements (BIS)
- The BIS was established in Basel in early 1930 to facilitate German reparations payments under the Treaty of Versailles. After the rise of the National Socialists in 1933, it shifted its focus to fostering monetary cooperation.
- The BIS operates as an unelected, unaccountable central bank of central bankers with complete immunity from national laws and taxation. It hosts bi-monthly meetings in absolute secrecy.
- The principal functions of the BIS include facilitating central bank collaboration, promoting financial stability, researching policy issues, acting as a counterparty in financial transactions, and serving as an agent or trustee in international financial operations.

### True Nature of the BIS
- Professor Carroll Quigley, in "Tragedy and Hope," revealed that the BIS aims to create a world system of financial control in private hands, dominating political systems and economies globally.
- The BIS, controlled by the House of Rothschild, seeks a single world currency, a one-world economic system, and global governance, where national laws become irrelevant.

### Expansion of Central Banks Post-World War II
- After World War II, the dissolution of European colonial empires led to the establishment of more central banks. Currently, there are 157 central banks worldwide, with eight in private ownership.
- These private central banks include the National Bank of Belgium, Bank of Greece, Banca d’Italia, Bank of Japan, South African Reserve Bank, Swiss National Bank, Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, and the United States Federal Reserve Bank.

### Mathematical Insights
- The Federal Reserve Bank's establishment and subsequent policies significantly contributed to the Great Depression, marked by drastic fluctuations in money supply and interest rates. This manipulation led to widespread bank failures and economic hardship.
- The BIS's role in managing central banks globally involves complex financial operations, including currency exchange stabilization, interest rate adjustments, and influencing national economic policies through coordinated efforts.

### Conclusion
- The coordinated establishment and operation of these central banks indicate an international money trust's influence, aligning with the goals set by early 20th-century financial leaders.


# The Great Depression

## United States Federal Reserve Bank

### Speculative Boom and Bust
- Investments were diverted into the stock market, causing the price/earnings ratio to rise rapidly, with some cases reaching 50.
- On 9 March 1929, Paul Warburg, freemason and founder of the Federal Reserve Bank, advised member banks and Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon to exit the stock market.
- On 24 October 1929, the Federal Reserve Bank increased the rediscount rate to 6%, causing panic and initiating the stock market crash.
- By 30 October 1929, the Federal Reserve Bank ordered the contraction of brokers’ loans by $2.3 million, further plummeting the stock market.

### Economic and Social Consequences
- The stock market crash led to an 83.1% decline in the value of listed securities from $89 billion to $15 billion by December 1932.
- Out of 24,000 banks, 10,000 failed, resulting in widespread ruin for depositors.
- 200,000 companies filed for bankruptcy, and 8.3 million people were rendered jobless.
- The national unemployment rate soared to 24.9%.
- The total National Income of the United States declined by 40.7% from $81 billion in 1927 to $48 billion in 1932.
- An estimated three million people died due to malnutrition, infectious diseases, starvation, and suicide during the depression years.

### Criticism and Analysis
- Congressman Louis T. McFadden stated that the stock market collapse was a “carefully contrived occurrence” orchestrated by international bankers to establish control.
- A.N. Field criticized the failure of central banks to prevent financial crises and suggested that the Federal Reserve’s actions were deliberately destabilizing.
- Professor Karl Gustav Cassel noted the haphazard and ignorant manner in which the Federal Reserve Board used its power, appalled by its lack of direction in American monetary policy.

### McFadden’s Speech on the Federal Reserve
- On 10 June 1932, Louis T. McFadden, former chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee, delivered a powerful speech in the United States House of Representatives, condemning the Federal Reserve Board and Banks.
- McFadden accused the Federal Reserve of cheating the U.S. government and the people, impoverishing the nation, and acting as private credit monopolies.
- He detailed the manipulation and exploitation by international bankers, the corruption of the Federal Reserve Act, and the dire need for banking reform.

### Conclusion
- The Great Depression exposed the catastrophic effects of speculative finance and the manipulative practices of central banking.
- The concerns about the Federal Reserve’s role and its detrimental impact on the economy and society remain a significant part of the historical discourse on financial regulation and reform.

U.S. Congressman Louis Thomas McFadden served as Chairman of the United States House Committee on Banking (1920-1931). His persistent exposure of the US Federal Reserve Bank’s “gigantic train of crime” led to his assassination on 1 October 1936.

The concerns raised by the Labour Party in South Africa during the debate on the South African Banking and Currency Bill that “what had been done in the USA was not in the interests of the public but of the banks” were fully justified. The establishment of the South African Reserve Bank, modeled after the US Federal Reserve Bank, which McFadden described as “one of the most corrupt and evil institutions in the world,” is a matter of deep regret and must be censured in the strongest terms.



## Clifford Hugh Douglas

### Background
- Clifford Hugh Douglas (1879-1952) was an engineer who noticed a discrepancy in the flow of money through industry while working at the Royal Aircraft Factory during World War I.
- He observed that the total costs of goods exceeded the sums paid in wages, salaries, and dividends, leading to a persistent deficit in consumer purchasing power relative to production costs.

### Social Credit Theory
- Douglas collected data from hundreds of companies and developed his economic theory known as Social Credit.
- He proposed the payment of a national dividend to all citizens to bridge the gap between earnings and prices, providing consumers with the additional buying power necessary to absorb all current production of goods in a non-inflationary manner.
- His A + B theorem stated that prices are always generated at a faster rate than incomes, causing the total prices of all goods to exceed the total buying power of consumers at any stage.

### Key Proposals
- **National Dividend**: A payment to all citizens to increase purchasing power and balance the economy.
- **Just Price Mechanism**: A price adjustment mechanism that would reduce prices based on technological efficiencies, ensuring the benefits of technology directly improved workers' standards of living.
- Douglas believed that technological advances would make full employment impossible, hence the need for a national dividend.

### Implementation and Impact
- After World War I, Douglas promoted his ideas globally, giving lectures in Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and Norway.
- **Alberta, Canada**: The Social Credit Party gained control of the provincial government in 1935 and implemented Douglas’s policies.
- **Japan**: After Douglas's lecture tour in 1929, the Japanese government adopted his policies in 1932.

### Opposition and Legacy
- International bankers feared Douglas’s policies and funded a substantial counter-campaign with £5 million in the 1930s to oppose his public enlightenment efforts.
- Douglas was critical of central banking, famously describing the Bank of England as a "mental institution" in a 1937 speech in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.

### Conclusion
- Douglas’s Social Credit theory sought to address the systemic flaws in the economic structure by ensuring adequate consumer purchasing power and distributing the benefits of technological progress.
- His ideas influenced policies in Alberta and Japan, highlighting an alternative approach to economic management and monetary reform.


## Irving Norton Fisher

### Background
- Irving Fisher (1867-1947) was a renowned professor of economics at Yale University known for his mathematical approach to economics.
- He is notable for his utility theory, juxtaposing the measurability of the utility function to demand theory, and for his work on the Theory of Interest and the Quantity Theory of Money.
- Fisher was also active in the eugenics movement.

### Early Contributions and Challenges
- In March 1913, Senator Robert L. Owen, with Fisher's assistance, tried to introduce a bill that included staple commodities as part of the monetary base alongside gold and silver. This would have prevented inflation or deflation and ensured freedom of employment.
- The bill was blocked by conspirators who blackmailed Fisher, leading him to withdraw his support and advocate for a "commodity" dollar based on a gold index instead.

### The Chicago Plan
- In 1920, Fisher published "Dollar Stabilisation," which later became known as the Chicago Plan.
- The plan proposed that the state should create the nation’s money supply and that private banks should operate as full reserve banks.
- Fisher's mathematical proofs demonstrated that full employment, the abolition of business cycles, and zero inflation could be achieved.

### Impact and Validation
- In August 2012, IMF researchers Jaromir Benes and Michael Kumhoff revisited the Chicago Plan and confirmed Fisher’s findings.
- Their research concluded that the Chicago Plan could significantly reduce business cycle volatility, eliminate bank runs, and reduce both government and private debt levels.
- The plan would achieve these benefits by making government-issued money the central liquid asset, allowing banks to focus on extending credit for investment projects requiring risk management expertise.

### Mathematical Insights
- Fisher’s analysis showed that full reserve banking would stabilize the economy, reduce interest rate risk spreads, minimize distortionary taxes, and lower the costs of monitoring unnecessary risks.
- The IMF study found that the Chicago Plan could generate steady-state output gains and enable zero steady-state inflation without liquidity traps, countering claims that government monopoly on money issuance would be inflationary.

### Conclusion
- Irving Fisher’s work, particularly the Chicago Plan, highlighted the potential for a reformed monetary system that could provide economic stability and reduce debt.
- His contributions continue to influence economic thought and policy discussions, particularly in the context of full reserve banking and monetary reform.




# The Rise and Fall of State Banking (1932-1945)

>  "You are aware that the gold standard has been the ruin of the States which adopted it, for it has not been able to satisfy the demands for money, the more so that we have removed gold from circulation as far as possible”
- Protocal No. 20

> "I next argued that the gold standard, the fixing of rates of exchange and so forth were shibboleths which I had never regarded and never would regard as weighty and immutable principles of economy. Money, to me, was simply a token of exchange for work done, and its value depended absolutely on the value of the work accomplished. Where money did not represent services rendered, I insisted, it had no value at all”.
- Adolf Hitler

## Reichsbank: The State Bank of National Socialist Germany

### Background and Ideology
- The gold standard failed to meet monetary demands, leading to economic challenges.
- Adolf Hitler viewed money as a token of exchange for work done, its value dependent on the value of the work accomplished.
- The 1930s' economic chaos induced by Rothschild-controlled central banks set the stage for a new financial system in Germany.

### Influence of Gottfried Feder
- In May 1919, Adolf Hitler attended a lecture by Dr. Gottfried Feder on the abolition of interest servitude.
- Feder's ideas influenced Hitler's thoughts on separating stock exchange capital from the economic life of the nation.
- Feder's principles became central to the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), with an emphasis on abolishing interest servitude.

### Establishment and Policies of the Reichsbank
- Upon gaining power on 30 January 1933, the National Socialists implemented monetary reform to finance state work and rearmament programs.
- Two dummy corporations, Offa and Mefo, were created to issue bills of exchange for state orders, discounted at the Reichsbank.
- Hjalmar Schacht, President of the Reichsbank, opposed the extension of these bills, fearing inflation, and was subsequently dismissed in January 1939.

### Transition to State-Controlled Banking
- On 19 January 1939, Hitler dismissed Schacht and ordered the Reichsbank to grant the Reich all requested credits.
- The Reichsbank was restructured to be unconditionally subordinated to the state, with Hitler assuming direct control.
- A new Reichsbank law promulgated on 15 June 1939 made the bank the Deutsche Reichsbank, directed by the Führer and Reich Chancellor.

### Mathematical and Economic Implications
- The monetary reforms led to a 100% increase in Germany's Gross National Product between 1933 and 1939.
- Germany's state banking system aimed to eliminate interest-bearing debt and finance public projects through non-interest-bearing bonds.

### Provocations Leading to World War II
- The transformation of the Reichsbank and Germany's economic independence from international bankers triggered fears of replication of this system globally.
- On 31 March 1939, Great Britain deceitfully guaranteed Poland's sovereignty, leading to increased tensions and provocations.
- Between March and September 1939, the Polish government harassed and attacked ethnic Germans, culminating in the Bromberg massacre on 3 September 1939.

### Conclusion
- Hitler's departure from the international banking fold and the establishment of a state-controlled Reichsbank played a significant role in the lead-up to World War II.
- The realization that Germany's usury-free state banking system could threaten the global financial empire of the Rothschilds was a key factor in the conflict's onset.


## Post World War II Developments

- In May 1945, the Deutsche Reichsbank ceased operations. Its affairs were only wrapped up in 1961.
- The Bank deutscher Länder (Bank of German States) succeeded it in the western half of Germany on 1 March 1948.
- This bank introduced the Deutsche Mark on 21 June 1948 and later became known as the Deutsche Bundesbank, established on 26 July 1957.
- The Deutsche Bundesbank was legally independent and modeled on the US Federal Reserve Bank. However, the Bundestag exerted considerable control over its policies, making it less independent than most central banks today.

### The European Central Bank (ECB)
- During 2001, due to its membership in the European Central Bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank ceded most of its authority to the ECB.
- The remaining responsibilities shared with the ECB include issuing bank notes, managing the clearing house, bank supervision, and managing currency reserves.
- The ECB's principal objective, as laid down in Article 127 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, is to maintain price stability.
- This focus on price stability has been linked to record levels of unemployment, low GDP growth, and a declining birth rate.

### Establishment of the ECB
- The ECB was established on 1 January 1998 and formally became operational on 1 January 1999 with the introduction of the Euro.
- The ECB is situated at Kaiserstrasse 29, Frankfurt am Main, near the Judengasse (Jews’ Lane) where Mayer Amschel Rothschild and his brother Kalman set up a shop in the 1780s.
- The 18 countries that adopted the Euro and joined the ECB are now subjected to the control of this Rothschild-controlled bank, leading to their financial subjugation and enslavement.


## Fascist Italy

- On 28 October 1922, Benito Mussolini and his National Fascist Party came to power.
- Fascism is more appropriately described as corporatism, symbolizing a merger of state and corporate power.
- In 1936, the Chamber of Deputies was replaced by a National Council of Corporations with 823 representatives from industry, labor, and the states, guiding industry and settling labor disputes.
- In the 1920s, a program of public works was instituted through deficit spending, which was unrivaled in modern Europe at that time:
  - Bridges, canals, autostrada of 2,485 miles (4,000 km), hospitals, schools, railway stations, and orphanages were built.
  - Forests were planted, and universities were endowed.
  - The Pontine marshes were drained, reclaiming 310 square miles (802 sq. km).
- As part of the program of national self-sufficiency (autarky), agriculture was subsidized and regulated.


## The State Bank of Italy

- In 1926, Mussolini first intervened in the banking sector by granting the Banca d’Italia jurisdiction over the issue of bank notes and the management of minimum requirements for bank reserves, including gold.
  - This policy was part of Mussolini's effort to create an autarkic state, not subject to the vagaries of world trade and finance.
- In 1927, Italy received a loan from JP Morgan of $100 million to meet a special emergency.
  - Mussolini subsequently refused to negotiate or accept any more foreign loans, aiming to keep Italy free from financial subservience to foreign banking interests.
- In 1931, the state took the right to supervise all major banks through the Istituto Mobiliare Italiano (Institute of Italian Securities).
- In 1936, the process was completed with the Atto Reforma Bancaria (Banking Reform Act):
  - The Banca d’Italia and the major banks became state institutions.
  - The Banca d’Italia was now a fully-fledged state bank with the sole right to create credit out of nothing and advance it for a nominal fee to other banks.
  - Limits on state borrowing were lifted, and Italy abandoned the gold standard.


## The State Bank of Japan

- The Bank of Japan (Nippon Ginkō) was founded on 10 October 1882, operating initially as a typical central bank for the benefit of private banks, to the detriment of public interest.
- In 1929, C.H. Douglas lectured in Japan, promoting his social credit ideas, which were well received by Japanese leaders in government and industry. His works were widely translated and distributed in Japan.
- The reorganization of the Bank of Japan into a state bank began in 1932 and was completed in 1942, with the Bank of Japan Law modeled after Germany’s Reichsbank Act of January 1939.
- The reformed Bank of Japan was declared a special corporation of a strongly national nature, managed with national aims as its guiding principle. The law empowered it to supervise industrial finance and make unlimited advances to the government without security.

### Economic Impact of State Banking in Japan
- The conversion from a central to a state banking system produced swift and sustained economic improvements.

#### Economic Indices of Japan 1931-41

- Manufacturing output and industrial production increased by 140% and 136%, respectively, from 1931 to 1941.
- National income and Gross National Product (GNP) increased by 241% and 259%, respectively.
- Unemployment declined from 5.5% in 1930 to 3.0% in 1938, and industrial disputes significantly decreased.
- By the late 1930s, Japan had become the leading economic power in East Asia, with exports steadily replacing those of America and England.

### The Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere
- In August 1940, Japan announced the formation of the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, aiming to establish economic and political cooperation among East Asian nations.
- Japan's rising economic power posed a significant threat to the Rothschild-owned and controlled US Federal Reserve Bank, leading to increased tensions that eventually contributed to the outbreak of war.

## How Japan Was Forced into World War II

- From July 1939, relations between Japan and the United States rapidly deteriorated after the USA unilaterally abrogated the Treaty of Commerce of 1911, restricting Japan’s ability to import essential raw materials.
- In June 1940, the USA imposed an aviation fuel embargo on Japan, followed by a ban on the export of iron and steel in November 1940.
- On 25 July 1941, all Japanese assets in England, Holland, and America were frozen after Japan, with the permission of Vichy France, peacefully occupied Indochina to block China’s southern supply routes.
- President Franklin D. Roosevelt closed the Panama Canal to all Japanese shipping and enforced a rubber and oil embargo, resulting in Japan losing 88% of its oil supplies, which was vital for its survival.

### Increasing Tensions and Military Preparations
- General Hideki Tojo, Prime Minister of Japan (October 1941 – July 1944), noted in his diary how the United States continually thwarted Japanese efforts at maintaining peace.
- Japan’s peaceful commercial relations were being persistently undermined by the USA, posing a grave threat to its future existence.
- The economic blockade created a noose around Japan’s neck. The USA, England, China, and Holland were encircling Japan through economic pressures, while naval forces in the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaya were being redeployed and strengthened.
- American battleships were observed in the seas surrounding Japan, and an American admiral claimed that the Japanese fleet could be sunk in a couple of weeks.
- British Prime Minister Churchill declared that England would join America’s side within 24 hours.

### Diplomatic Efforts and Failure
- General Tojo wrote about Japan’s attempts to circumvent these dangerous circumstances by diplomatic negotiation, offering numerous concessions to find a mutual compromise.
- Despite Japan's diplomatic efforts, including the offer of a summit on 8 August 1941, the United States remained steadfast in its original position, demanding complete withdrawal of Japanese troops from China, repudiation of the Nanking government, and withdrawal from the Tripartite Pact.
- By 2 December 1941, Japan had been cut off from 75% of its normal trade due to the Allied blockade, forcing Japan into a desperate situation.

### Conclusion
- Faced with uncompromising and unrelenting economic and military pressure from the United States and its allies, Japan felt compelled to take retaliatory action to maintain its prosperity and secure its existence as a sovereign nation.
- The deliberate provocations by the usurers in New York had successfully provoked Japan into attacking America, leading to the outbreak of World War II in the Pacific.

## Post World War II Developments

- Following Japan’s defeat, one of the first acts of the United States occupation forces in Japan in September 1945 was to restructure the Japanese banking system to comply with the norms of international bankers, i.e., usury.
- The unrestricted financing of the state by the Bank of Japan was abolished, and the large industrial combines, the Zaibatsu, were dismantled. This policy was carried out by Joseph Dodge, a Detroit banker, who served as the financial adviser to the Supreme Allied Commander, General Douglas MacArthur.
- The Ministry of Finance was able to retain a measure of control over the banking system, particularly monetary policy.
- In 1988, Japan was adversely affected by its compliance with the Basel I regulations, which obliged the Bank of Japan to raise the minimum capital requirements of its risk-related assets from 2% to 8%. This action precipitated an on-off recession that has lasted for the past 29 years.
- In April 1998, the Ministry of Finance was forced by law to yield to the independent Bank of Japan. Since then, the Bank of Japan has functioned as a typical Rothschild-controlled central bank, seldom performing its duties in the best interests of the Japanese people.



# Modern Forms of State Banking

> "Banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin. The bankers own the earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create deposits, and with a flick of the pen, they will create enough deposits to buy it back again. However, take it away from them, and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear, for this would be a happier and better world to live in. But, if you wish to remain the slaves of the bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, let them continue to create deposits."
> — Sir Josiah Stamp, former director of the Bank of England

## Bank of North Dakota

- **Establishment and Purpose**: 
  - In 1919, North Dakota established its own state bank, the only state in the United States to do so.
  - The mission of the Bank of North Dakota (BND) is to provide sound financial services that promote agriculture, commerce, and industry.
  
- **Economic Performance**: 
  - North Dakota has a population of 790,000 and is primarily an agricultural state.
  - Despite harsh winters, it leads the U.S. in the production of wheat, barley, canola, flaxseed, oats, and sunflower seeds.
  - The state also has significant shale oil and lignite mining operations.
  
- **Financial Stability**: 
  - North Dakota is one of the few states in the U.S. with a budget surplus, unlike many other states that are technically insolvent.
  - As of September 2012, North Dakota had a budget surplus of $1.6 billion.
  - The state's GDP grew by 93.4% from $16 billion in 1997 to $31 billion in 2010.
  - Personal income per capita increased by 127% from $20,155 in 2000 to $45,747 in 2011, compared to a national increase of 37.4% over the same period.
  
- **Bank Operations**: 
  - By law, the state must deposit all its funds in BND, which pays a competitive interest rate to the state treasurer.
  - BND pays all its profits to the state, which amounted to $60 million in 2011 and over $450 million in the past 11 years.
  - These funds are used to offset taxes, provide a secondary market for real estate loans, guarantee new business ventures, and offer loans to farmers at an interest rate of 1% per annum.
  - There has been no credit crisis in North Dakota, as BND provides the state's own credit.

- **Infrastructure Loan Fund**: 
  - In 2015, the North Dakota Legislative Assembly established a Bank of North Dakota Infrastructure Loan Fund program.
  - This program made $50 million available to communities with populations under 2,000 and $100 million to communities with populations over 2,000.
  - Loans have a 2% fixed interest rate and terms of up to 30 years, supporting new construction of water and treatment plants, sewer and water lines, transportation infrastructure, and other growth needs.

- **Potential for State Banking**: 
  - While state banking may not resolve financial issues at the national level, it has the potential to provide significant relief at the state government level.
  - Benefits include budget surpluses, lower taxes, reduced unemployment, and higher levels of prosperity.
  - As of December 2016, 25 states were considering some form of state banking legislation.


## The States of Guernsey

### Historical Context
- In 1815, after the Napoléonic wars, Guernsey's economy was struggling. The island's infrastructure, including roads and dykes, was in disrepair, and the economy had slumped.
- Unable to borrow money due to its inability to raise taxes to pay interest, Guernsey needed a solution to fund public works.

### Innovative Financial Solution
- In 1816, the Committee of the States of Guernsey issued £6,000 in one-pound notes, free of debt and interest, to fund public works and a new marketplace.
- Within two years, the necessary works were completed without adding to the state debt.

### Further Issuances and Economic Impact
- In 1824, an additional £5,000 (some in five-pound notes) was authorized to rebuild Elizabeth College and parochial schools.
- By 1837, £55,000 were in circulation, leading to increased trade, tourism, and unprecedented levels of prosperity.

### Expansion and Modern Impact
- By 1914, the States notes issued had increased to £142,000 and £175,000 by 1937.
- The cost of printing these notes was £450, compared to an annual interest charge of £11,383 per annum (6.5%).
- By 1958, there were £542,765 in existence, and currently, there are £43.8 million in circulation.

### Economic Stability and Taxation
- Today, Guernsey, with a population of 65,400, enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the world.
- The island has a flat income tax rate of 20% on worldwide income, capped at £220,000 per annum.
- There is no company tax, except for a 10% tax on certain banking activities, no capital gains tax, no inheritance tax or estate duty, no purchase or sales tax, no value-added tax (VAT), and no capital transfer tax.
- Guernsey has neither a national debt nor any external debt.

## Central Bank of Libya

### Historical Background
- Libya was ruled by the Ottoman Empire from 1551 to 1911, by Italy from 1911 to 1943, and under British and French military suzerainty from 1943 to 1951.
- The Central Bank of Libya was founded in 1956 and operated as a typical central bank until the bloodless coup d’état of 1 September 1969.

### Economic Transformation Under Qathafi
- Oil of exceptionally high quality was discovered in Libya in 1959, but King Idris al Mahdi as-Sanusi failed to capitalize on this resource for the benefit of the Libyan people.
- After taking power in 1969, Mu’ammar Qathafi nationalized the central bank and operated it as a state bank, effectively banning foreign bankers.
- Financing of government infrastructure did not attract interest (riba), and Libya had no national or foreign debt. Its foreign exchange reserves exceeded $54 billion by 2010.
- During the period 2000-2010, GDP growth was 4.32% per annum, and the official inflation rate was -0.27%.

### Social and Economic Benefits Under Qathafi
- Free education and payment of average salary to students for their studies.
- Students studying overseas received accommodation, an automobile, and €2,500 per annum.
- Free electricity, health care, and housing with no mortgages.
- Newly-wed couples received a gift of 60,000 dinar ($50,000) from the government.
- Automobiles were sold at factory cost, free of interest, and private loans were provided free of interest.
- Bread cost 15 US cents per loaf, and gasoline cost 12 US cents per liter.
- A portion of profits from oil sales was paid directly into citizens' bank accounts.
- Farmers received free land, seeds, and animals.
- Full employment with temporarily unemployed individuals receiving a full salary.

### Achievements and Infrastructure Projects
- Qathafi’s Jamahiriya system ensured wealth distribution and high living standards, with a literacy rate of 82% and life expectancy of 75 years.
- The Great Man-Made River project supplied 6.5 million cubic meters of fresh water daily to major cities, financed without foreign loans and costing $25 billion.

### Geopolitical Implications and NATO Intervention
- Despite being labeled a dictator, Qathafi had the support of 90% of the population, excluding Benghazi.
- Libya's central bank, run on state banking lines, exhibited full employment, zero inflation, and widespread prosperity.
- Qathafi’s proposal in 2010 to create a gold dinar for foreign transactions was a significant threat to the petrodollar system, leading to NATO intervention under the pretext of human rights abuses.
- Historical parallels include Iraq's shift to euros for oil payments in 2000, which was a factor in the invasion and toppling of Saddam Hussein.

### The Iranian Oil Bourse
- Since 2007, Iran has stipulated payments in euros, and in February 2008, the Iranian Oil Bourse was established to trade petroleum using primarily the euro and other non-US currencies.
- The establishment of this bourse is considered a prime cause for ongoing threats against Iran by Israel and the USA.



# The Banking Crisis

> “I am afraid that the ordinary citizen will not like to be told that the banks can, and do, create and destroy money. The amount of money in existence varies only with the actions of the banks increasing and decreasing deposits and bank purchases...and they who control the credit of a nation, direct the policy of Governments and hold in the hollow of their hands the destiny of the people.”
> – Reginald McKenna, former Chancellor of the Exchequer.

## Historical Overview

Banking crises generally take three forms:
1. Individual bank collapses due to a lack of confidence and withdrawal of deposits.
2. Bank runs where multiple banks fail simultaneously.
3. Systemic implosions affecting the entire banking system.

### Early Banking Crises
- **18th Century Crises**: Confined to countries with central banks and usury, such as England, the Netherlands, and Sweden.
  - **1710-1720**: The Sword Blade Bank and the South Sea Company incidents in England.
  - **1763**: Leendert Pieter de Neufville's wissels triggered a run on banks in the Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden.
  - **1772**: Neal, James, Fordyce and Down collapse in London, spreading contagion to Amsterdam.

### Central Banking Model and Crises
- The central banking model allows private banks to create money as an interest-bearing debt and destroy it once repaid.
- **Early US Panics**:
  - **1792 and 1796-1797**: First Bank of the United States induced panics by withholding credit.
  - **1819**: Rothschild-owned Second Bank of the United States caused a financial disaster and depression.
- **England**:
  - **1825 and 1847**: Panics resulted in the closure of numerous banks.
- **US Gold Standard**:
  - **1857**: Panic due to a fabricated gold shortage and Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company failure.
  - **1873**: US recession following the adoption of the gold standard, leading to a four-year downturn.

### Planned Financial Chaos
- **Late 19th to Early 20th Century US Panics**:
  - **1884, 1890, 1890-1, 1893-4, 1897, 1903, 1907**: Orchestrated panics to induce confusion and despair, culminating in the establishment of the US central bank in 1913.
- **Great Depression**: Contrived by the US Federal Reserve Bank, followed by relative stability until the 1990s.
- **Late 20th Century Crises**:
  - Economic crises and financial difficulties affected various countries, including Finland, Sweden, Venezuela, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand, Russia, Argentina, Ecuador, and Uruguay.


## The Banking Crisis 2007

The seeds of the current banking crisis were sown when the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which prohibited bank holding companies from owning financial institutions and separated banks from investment houses, was abrogated on 12 November 1999. At the time of the promulgation of the original Act, Senator Carter Glass, a former US Secretary of the Treasury and one of its authors, remarked that “With a gun a man can rob a bank, with a bank a man can rob the world”.

It was deemed towards the end of President Clinton’s administration that everyone had the right to own a home, and for this purpose the Department of Housing and Development initiated a programme called National Homeownership Strategy Partners in the American Dream. In order to attract as many new homeowners as possible, credit standards and regulations were relaxed and the government allowed borrowers a tax credit of $8,000. Low teaser interest rates were offered for the first two years, but with substantially higher rates being payable thereafter.

### Housing Market Boom and Bust
- Between 1998 and 2006 house prices rose by 124%, but two years later in 2008, a drop of 20% was recorded.
- The ratio of the cost of an average house to median household income rose from 3.0 (1980-2000) to 4.6 by 2006.
- Credit default swaps, intended to hedge or speculate against credit risks, increased from $47 trillion to a notional value of $683 trillion between 1998 and 2008.

### Financial Products and Market Collapse
- Innovative financial products, such as collaterised debt obligations, were developed to fuel the property boom.
- Mortgages of varying degrees of quality were bundled and sold to investors, often fraudulently rated as triple A by rating agencies.
- The shadow banking sector, including investment banks and hedge funds, aggressively marketed these products, amassing over $100 trillion in funds.
- By June 2007, 39% of all home loans did not meet the underwriting standards of any issuer.

### The Crisis Unfolds
- Lehmann Brothers was declared bankrupt on 15 September 2008, triggering a financial collapse.
- Congress approved a $700 million Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) as an initial rescue package.
- The US Federal Reserve Bank has since granted over $16 trillion worth of assistance to domestic and foreign banks, with estimates suggesting the final figure may exceed $24 trillion.

### Quantitative Easing and Balance Sheet Expansion
- Between 2008 and 2013, the US Federal Reserve Bank expanded its balance sheet by 500% to $5 trillion to prop up the insolvent banking sector.
- Between 2007 and 2012, the balance sheets of the six largest western banks were inflated by 36.4% from $10.7 trillion to $14.6 trillion.


## Causatum

In the aftermath of this financial crisis, attempts have been made to remedy what is in essence an insoluble problem. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act passed into law on 21 July 2010 contains numerous regulations designed to promote accountability, financial stability, and transparency. 200 pages of the Act are devoted to mortgage reform and include higher underwriting standards and an obligation on mortgage originators to ensure that borrowers have the ability to repay their loans.

### Regulatory Responses
- The Dodd-Frank Act aims to promote accountability, financial stability, and transparency.
- It includes higher underwriting standards and obligations on mortgage originators to ensure the borrower's ability to repay loans.

### Basel Committee Proposals
- The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has proposed higher levels of capital and liquidity ratios.
- The implementation of these measures is intended to be completed by 31 March 2019.
- These measures may have the opposite effect, causing the money supply to shrink and deepening the recession.

### Fundamental Issues
- The current economic system relies on sinking further into debt to keep the economy running, as debt-based money is the primary means of exchange.
- A worldwide debt cancellation could be considered if the money supply could be replaced by state bank-created interest-free and debt-free money.

### Consequences of Growth and Industrialization
- The deindustrialization of the developed world leads to the production of inferior goods in third-world countries to fuel growth.
- Europe's insistence on economic growth is contradictory to its shrinking indigenous population.
- Planned obsolescence and forced growth have negative environmental impacts.

### Hidden Purposes
- The principal hidden purpose of the banking crisis is to create a general feeling of desperation and acclamation for a solution such as a World Central Bank.
- This mirrors the late 19th-century situation in the United States when banking panics were artificially created to prepare for the imposition of the US Federal Reserve Bank.
- The parasitic bankers may not achieve this objective if the host economy vanishes.

In conclusion, the principal hidden purpose of the banking crisis is to create a general feeling of desperation and an acclamation for a solution such as a World Central Bank. This mirrors the late 19th-century situation in the United States when banking panics were artificially created to prepare for the imposition of the US Federal Reserve Bank. Whether the parasitic bankers will achieve this objective is open to doubt as the host may well have vanished by then.



# The Banking Crisis
## The Great Depression of the 21st Century

One of the primary causes of the ballooning debt bubble has been the suicidal policy of globalization and free trade, which has resulted in the partial deindustrialization of the United States, United Kingdom, and Europe. The relocation of industries to third-world countries has precipitated a reduction in the manufacturing base of the developed world, structural unemployment of a permanent nature, and a widening trade gap. In an attempt to maintain their falling standards of living, consumers in these affected countries have been forced to take on increasing levels of personal debt.

- In the United States during the 1980s, $2.37 of private debt were required to produce $1 of growth in GDP.
- In the 1990s, the figure rose to $2.99.
- In the 2000s, there was a dramatic increase to $5.67 for each incremental dollar of economic growth – a level which will soon become untenable.

A further aggravating factor is the rising cost of extracting energy, also known as the energy return on energy invested (EROEI), which is rapidly approaching a tipping point. According to a Tullett Prebon report:
- In 1990, the theoretical cost of energy would have been 2.43% of GDP.
- In 2010, it almost doubled to 4.7% of GDP.
- It is predicted to rise to 9.6% of GDP by 2020 and to 15% by 2030.

This decline in energy returns will cause widespread closures of mines and industries and adversely affect agriculture, leading to a substantial drop in living standards.

### Other Predicaments Facing Mankind
- **Water Scarcity:** During the past 100 years, water consumption has quadrupled and continues to rise. Currently, 1.6 billion people are facing absolute water scarcity, and global demand for water will exceed supply by 40% by 2030.
- **Collapse in Birth Rates:** The collapse in the birth rate of the developed world is a significant concern. At the turn of the 20th century, the White population of the world numbered 590 million or 36% of its 1.65 billion total. In 2016, although that number had increased to 1 billion, its relative share of the world’s population of 7.5 billion has shrunk to 13.3%.

### Fertility Rates
The table below reveals the inevitability and near mathematical certainty that by 2100 most of the Whites and a large portion of the Asian peoples of northeast Asia will have died out.

#### Countries with Population in Excess of 100 Million
- Nigeria: 5.32
- Pakistan: 3.52
- Egypt: 2.89
- Bangladesh: 2.83
- India: 2.81
- Indonesia: 2.18
- Mexico: 2.21

#### Major White and Far East Asian Countries
- USA: 2.05
- UK: 1.94
- Brazil: 1.90
- France: 1.89
- Australia: 1.79
- Sweden: 1.67
- Canada: 1.53
- Germany: 1.41
- Spain: 1.41
- Italy: 1.38
- Russia: 1.34
- Japan: 1.27
- China: 1.05
- South Africa: 2.64 (White fertility rate: 1.5)

The accepted fertility rate for the replacement of a population is 2.11. Thus, the White, Chinese, and Japanese populations will be severely depleted within three generations and unless the fertility rate substantially increases, will face eventual extinction.

### Impact of Gender Equality and Feminism
Since World War II, ever-increasing numbers of married women in the Western world, influenced by the propaganda of feminism and gender equality, have been forced to seek employment to pay the ever-increasing amounts of interest necessary to make ends meet. Most of this interest is accrued on mortgage loans, i.e., on money that banks have created out of nothing. This financial system has undermined normal family life and dramatically reduced female fertility.

### Conclusion
Even if the usury system should be abolished in its entirety within the next five to ten years, these trends will not be easily reversed over both the short and medium term. If usury remains intact, then the world must brace itself for a depression similar to the Dark Ages, which will last for many centuries.

The past 300 years, notwithstanding numerous technological advancements, have witnessed a progressive deterioration in Western and European standards of civilization. The excessive concentration of power and wealth, based exclusively on dishonest banking methods, has enabled a tiny minority of criminal bankers to control the media and educational processes, and thereby brainwash a mindless and atomized humanity into suicidal practices of savage, bloody, and pointless wars, central banking, and cultural degradation, which will eventually result in its demographic extinction.
