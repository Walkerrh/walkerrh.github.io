- **Context**:
  - Around 2400 BCE, the ruler of the Sumerian city of Lagash, Enmetena, recorded details of a conflict with the neighboring city, Umma, on a clay foundation cone.
  - This record included details about a loan of barley and the subsequent failure to repay it.

- **The Loan:**
  - Lagash lent a significant amount of barley at interest to Umma.
  - The loan is detailed in the inscription as follows:
    - "1 gur7 (of barley) the man of Umma got an interest-bearing loan (from Lagash). The decision followed. (The principal and interest) became 40,0,0,0 (sìla, whose order is) gur7."

- **Failure to Repay:**
  - Umma did not repay the loan, which had accrued compound interest.
  - The principal and interest had increased significantly over time, demonstrating the compounding effect.

- **Conflict and Resolution:**
  - After seven years, when repayment was not made, a conflict ensued.
  - Enmetena of Lagash ultimately defeated the ruler of Umma, Urlumma, and put him to death.
  - The subsequent ruler of Umma, Il, acknowledged the debt and repaid the barley to Lagash:
    - "10 gur7 of Lagash’s barley (7.5•(4/3) = 10) he repaid."

- **Mathematical Evidence:**
  - The Sumerian scribe calculated the compound interest on the loan correctly, a fact that modern scholars struggled to understand for a long time.
  - The calculation involved the principal of 1 gur7 of barley and an interest rate of 33 1/3% over seven years, resulting in a significant amount due.

- **Historical Significance:**
  - This event showcases the use of compound interest in ancient Sumerian society and its impact on inter-city relations.
  - It also highlights the advanced mathematical understanding of the Sumerians in calculating compound interest.

### Summary

The conflict between Sumer and Umma over a barley loan and its compound interest exemplifies the early use of complex financial concepts in ancient Mesopotamia. The accurate calculation of interest and the eventual repayment after a conflict underscore the significant role that compound interest played in Sumerian economics and societal interactions.
