prosperity depression sun-spot cycle
1844 Michael Faraday discovered the fundamental
relationship between magnetism and light
 earth's atmosphere
  air played the role of iron
atmosphere would increase or decrease in magnetism
depending on how much of the sun's energy was reaching the earth exactly the
same way iron in an electromagnet increases or decreases in magnetism
depending on how much current is run through the coil of wire. This is a
paraphrase of the information in several of Faraday's papers.
