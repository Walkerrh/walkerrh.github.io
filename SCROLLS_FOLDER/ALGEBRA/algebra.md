## Algebraic Expressions
### Description
Algebraic expressions are combinations of variables, numbers, and operations. They can be simplified or evaluated for given variable values.
### Formula
$$ a + b, \quad a - b, \quad a \times b, \quad \frac{a}{b} $$

## Solving Linear Equations
### Description
Linear equations are equations of the first degree, meaning they have no exponents greater than one.
### Formula
$$ ax + b = 0 $$
Solution:
$$ x = -\frac{b}{a} $$

## Solving Quadratic Equations
### Description
Quadratic equations are second-degree polynomial equations in a single variable.
### Formula
$$ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $$
Solution:
$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$

## Factoring Polynomials
### Description
Factoring is the process of breaking down a polynomial into simpler terms (the factors) whose product is the original polynomial.
### Formula
$$ ax^2 + bx + c = (px + q)(rx + s) $$

## Functions and Their Graphs
### Description
A function is a relation that assigns exactly one output value to each input value. Graphs of functions represent these relationships visually.

## Systems of Equations
### Description
Systems of equations are sets of equations with multiple variables that are solved simultaneously.

ax + by = c \\
dx + ey = f 
\end{cases} $$

## Inequalities
### Description
Inequalities express the relative size of two values. They are solved similarly to equations but require special rules for multiplication or division by negative numbers.
