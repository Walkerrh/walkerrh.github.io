# Naming Conventions in Different Contexts

# Military

The military uses several phonetic alphabets and standardized naming conventions for clear communication, especially in radio transmissions. The most well-known is the NATO phonetic alphabet:

| Letter | Code Word |
|--------|-----------|
| A      | Alpha     |
| B      | Bravo     |
| C      | Charlie   |
| D      | Delta     |
| E      | Echo      |
| F      | Foxtrot   |
| G      | Golf      |
| H      | Hotel     |
| I      | India     |
| J      | Juliet    |
| K      | Kilo      |
| L      | Lima      |
| M      | Mike      |
| N      | November  |
| O      | Oscar     |
| P      | Papa      |
| Q      | Quebec    |

# Tech Industry

In the tech industry, naming conventions for software, APIs, libraries, and other components are designed for clarity, versioning, and sometimes creativity:

1. **Semantic Versioning**: A common convention is semantic versioning, where version numbers are assigned in the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., 2.1.4).
2. **CamelCase**: Often used in programming languages for variables, functions, and classes (e.g., `myVariableName`, `MyClassName`).
3. **Snake_case**: Another convention used for naming variables and functions, especially in languages like Python (e.g., `my_variable_name`).
4. **PascalCase**: Similar to CamelCase, but the first letter is also capitalized, often used for class names (e.g., `MyClassName`).

# Evangelion (Neon Genesis Evangelion)

In the anime series "Neon Genesis Evangelion," the Evangelion units follow a simple numerical naming convention:

| Unit Number | Name                  |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| 00          | Evangelion Unit-00    |
| 01          | Evangelion Unit-01    |
| 02          | Evangelion Unit-02    |
| 03          | Evangelion Unit-03    |
| 04          | Evangelion Unit-04    |
