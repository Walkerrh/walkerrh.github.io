- **Water table**: The upper level of an unconfined aquifer, below which the ground is saturated with water.
- **Unconfined aquifer**: An aquifer that is not overlain by an impermeable layer, allowing water to flow in and out easily.
- **Groundwater**: Water that fills the cracks and spaces in underground soil and rock layers.
- **Confined aquifer**: An aquifer that is trapped between two impermeable layers of rock or sediment, which restricts water flow in and out.
- **Artesian well**: A well that taps into a confined aquifer, where the pressure forces water to the surface without the need for pumping.

### The Water Cycle

The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the Earth's surface. It involves:

1. **Evaporation**: Water changes from a liquid to a gas due to heat from the sun.
2. **Condensation**: Water vapor cools and changes back into liquid water, forming clouds.
3. **Precipitation**: Water falls back to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail, replenishing water sources.
4. **Runoff**: Water flows on the Earth's surface into streams, rivers, and eventually into larger bodies of water.
5. **Infiltration**: Water seeps into the ground, replenishing underground aquifers.
6. **Transpiration**: Plants release water vapor into the atmosphere through their leaves.

The water cycle is essential for maintaining the Earth's climate and ensuring the availability of freshwater.

### Distribution of Earth's Water

- Almost all living organisms on the planet use **the sun** as the ultimate source of energy.
- The **photic zone** of the open ocean has the greatest amount of net primary productivity.
- Due to biomagnification, **top consumers, like sharks** would have high levels of mercury poisoning and be unsafe for consumption.
- **A decrease in ocean water pH** is a result of carbon dioxide being absorbed into the oceans from the atmosphere.

### Three Prevalent Definitions of Ecology

- **Ecology** = The scientific study of the relationship between organisms and the environment. *Haeckel (late 1800-early 1900s)*
- **Ecology** = The study of the distribution and abundance of organisms. *Andrewartha and Birch (1954)*
- **Ecology** = "The study of the structure and function of nature." *Odum (1971)*

Odum and colleagues emphasized the study of ecosystems, including all organisms and functional processes.

### Ecology

Ecology is a multi-disciplinary branch of science that studies interactions between living organisms and their surroundings. It includes:
- Abiotic vs. Biotic components of the environment
- Ecological systems are studied at different levels:
  - Organismal
  - Population
  - Community
  - Ecosystem
  - Biosphere

### Population Ecology

**Demographics – Quantifiable Characteristics:**
- Population size
- Population density
- Geographical range
- Population dispersion patterns
- Population growth rate
- Carrying capacity
- Life history characteristics
- Survivorship among age classes

**Example: Polar Bears**
- Range throughout the Arctic region
- Approximately 25,000 polar bears
- Population size: Total number of individuals in a population
- Population density: Number of individuals per unit area or volume (about 10.4 polar bears per 1000 km²)
- Population distribution: Polar bears are typically spread out because of where they can find food
- Population dispersion patterns:
  - **Clumped**: Individuals are in patches
  - **Uniform**: Individuals are evenly spaced
  - **Random**: Unpredictable spacing in a population

**Estimation of Population Size & Density Methods:**
- Count random sub-samples
- Mark-recapture: Useful for information on movement and lifespan

**Population Ecology Demographics:**
- Population size
- Population density
- Geographical range
- Population dispersion patterns
- Population growth
- Life history
- Survivorship among age classes

### Population Growth Models

**BIDE Model (Birth-Immigration-Death-Emigration):**
- Change in population size depends on the number of births and deaths over a given time.
- \(N_{t+1} = N_t + B + I - D - E\)
- Open system = Immigration and/or emigration

**BD Model (Birth-Death):**
- Change in population size depends on the number of births and deaths over a given time.
- Population size \((N_{t+1})\) = Number of individuals \((N)\) + Number of births \((B)\) - Number of deaths \((D)\)
- \(N_{t+1}=N_t + B - D\)
- Closed system = No immigration or emigration

### Estimating Changes in Population Size Over Time

- **Per capita** = Per individual
- **Per capita birth rate** \((b = B/N)\): Number of offspring an individual in the population produces, on average
- **Per capita death rate** \((d = D/N)\): The chance of an individual in the population dying, on average
- **Per capita growth rate** \((r) = (B/N - D/N) = (b-d)\): Contribution of each individual in the population to total population growth rate
- \(N_{t+1} = N_t + rN_t\)
  - \(r > 0\) in a growing population
  - \(r < 0\) in a shrinking population
- **Total population growth rate**: \(\Delta N / \Delta T = rN_t\)

**Example: North Atlantic Right Whales**
- Endangered, protected, depleted
- Yearly migration from foraging grounds off New England to calving grounds off the southeastern USA (>1000 miles)
- 2021 estimated population: 350 to 380
- From 2012 to 2020: 90 total births, 121 total deaths, \(N = 365\)
- Per capita growth rate \((r) = (B/N - D/N) = (b-d)\)

### Population Growth Models: Exponential vs Logistic

- **Exponential Growth:**
  - \(N_{t+1} = N_t + rN_t\)
  - \(r = 1\), doubling time is constant for a population with constant \(r\)
  - \(\Delta N / \Delta T = rN_t\)
  - For very small differences in \(t\): \(dN / dT = rN\)

- **Logistic Growth:**
  - The value \(K\) is where the logistic growth curve starts to flatten
  - Per capita growth rate \((r)\) is ~0 at \(K =\) carrying capacity
  - \(r > 0\) in a growing population
  - \(r < 0\) in a shrinking population
  - \(\Delta N / \Delta T = rN (1-N/K)\): As \(N/K\) increases, population growth slows
  - \(K =\) carrying capacity, \(N =\) population size, \(r =\) per capita growth rate, \(t =\) time
  - **Density-dependent (logistic) population growth**: For very small differences in \(t\): \(dN / dT = rN (1-N/K)\)

**Factors Limiting Population Size:**
- **Biotic (density-dependent):**
  - Resource availability
  - Refuge/shelter
  - Predators
  - Competition
  - Availability of nesting sites
  - Parasites
  - Pathogens
  - Waste buildup
- **Abiotic (density-independent):**
  - Rainfall
  - Storms
  - Fire
  - Wind
  - Extreme cold or heat

**Carrying Capacity (\(K\)):**
- Maximum number (or density) of individuals in a population that a given environment can sustain indefinitely
- Fluctuates over time with changes in the environment
- The term \((N/K)\) describes the decline in per capita growth rate as \(N\) increases: \(dN / dT = rN (1-N/K)\)

**Life Histories and Growth:**
- Most populations exhibit logistic growth but may spend time in each phase
- **Life histories** show a continuum between \(K\)-selected species that stabilize at carrying capacity and \(r\)-selected species that grow quickly in numbers in new environments but have large fluctuations

**Intrinsic Growth Rate (\(r_{max}\)):**
- \(dN / dT = rN_t\): Ideal conditions, no limiting factors on growth, organism reaches biotic potential
- Factors determining intrinsic growth rate \((r_{max})\):
  - Life history
  - Lifespan
  - Age-at-maturity
  - Parity: Number of reproductive events in a lifetime
  - Fecundity: Number of offspring per reproductive event

### Survivorship Curves

- **Higher mortality early in life** leads to low mortality late in life
- **Constant mortality** throughout life
- **Low mortality early in life** leads to high mortality late in life
