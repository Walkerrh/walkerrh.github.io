# Motorcycle Care Guide

## Regular Maintenance Routine

- **Check Tires**: Inspect tire pressure, tread depth, and condition regularly. Replace tires when worn out or damaged.

- **Oil and Fluids**: Change engine oil and filter according to manufacturer recommendations. Check and top up brake fluid, coolant, and other fluids as needed.

- **Brakes**: Inspect brake pads and discs for wear. Replace pads if worn down and check brake fluid levels. Bleed brakes periodically for optimal performance.

- **Chain (if applicable)**: Clean and lubricate the chain regularly. Adjust chain tension as per manufacturer specifications to prevent excessive wear.

- **Battery**: Keep the battery terminals clean and charged. Replace the battery if it shows signs of weakness or inability to hold charge.

- **Lights and Electrics**: Check headlights, turn signals, brake lights, and other electrical components for proper functioning. Replace bulbs as necessary.

- **Suspension**: Inspect suspension components for leaks, damage, or wear. Adjust suspension settings and replace worn-out parts as recommended.

## Seasonal Maintenance

- **Winter Storage (if applicable)**: Prepare the motorcycle for winter storage by adding fuel stabilizer, changing oil, and protecting against moisture.

- **Spring Preparation**: Check all systems after winter storage, including tires, brakes, fluids, and battery. Ensure everything is in proper working order before riding.

## Cleaning and Care

- **Washing**: Regularly wash the motorcycle to remove dirt, grime, and corrosive elements. Use mild soap and water, avoiding high-pressure washers that may damage sensitive parts.

- **Polishing and Waxing**: Apply polish or wax to protect the paint and metal surfaces from UV rays and environmental contaminants.

- **Storage**: Store the motorcycle in a dry, covered area to prevent rust and damage from weather elements.

## Riding Practices

- **Warm-Up**: Allow the engine to warm up before riding to ensure proper lubrication and performance.

- **Maintenance Records**: Keep records of maintenance tasks, including dates and mileage, to track when services are due.
