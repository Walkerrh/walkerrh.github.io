# HUMAN AND ANIMAL RELATIONSHIPS

### Indigenous Peoples: 
ethnic groups that are the original settlers of a given region

## Types of Human Societies (according to subsistence strategy – how they get food)
* Hunter-gatherer – people that rely on foraging (hunting, fishing, and gathering wild
plants)
* Nomadic – people that have no fixed residence, that move from area to area usually
seasonally within a defined territory
* Pastoralist – people that rely on animal husbandry, usually herding (cattle, sheep, horses,
goats, yaks, llamas, reindeer, etc.); often nomadic or semi-nomadic
* Horticulturalist – small-scale farmers; produce only what they use themselves
* Agriculturalist – large-scale farmers; designed to feed multiple houses/communities,
often managed by outside entities, focused on only a few crops and creation of a singular
habitat in the field, more complex technologies
* Industrial – a society driven by use of technology and division of labor to create mass
production; people do not produce their own food, acquire it through the system

### Ecology: 
the science of the interrelationship between organisms and their environment

### Human ecology: 
the ecology of human communities, how a society lives in conjunction with its environment

### Biodiversity: 
the variability of living organisms in an environment

### Biosphere: 
the part of the world in which organic life exists; regions of the earth’s surface, hydrosphere, and atmosphere occupied by living organisms

### Consciousness: 
the state of awareness by the mind of itself and the world

### Animism: 
belief system in which all entities are animate (alive), including objects, plants, and natural phenomena; all things have spirit

### Multinaturalism: 
an indigenous Amerindian (New World) view of animals as persons with culture, just like humans. The essence of all persons (human and non-human) is humanity, so there is one culture, and many natures. Opposite of Western view: multiculturalism- one nature many cultures

### Reciprocity: 
the practice of exchanging things with others for mutual benefit, especially privileges granted by one country or organization to another.

### Familiarization: 
getting permission to take animals’ pieces, parts, and powers, to incorporate their resources into the Community/Self (alterity – bringing energy in from outside, from the Other). Since animals are people, without these ritual proscriptions, to kill and consume them would be murder and cannibalism.

### Shaman: 
a person that has access to, and influence in, other levels of reality, and the ability to enter a trance state during ritual to practice divination and healing.

### Oral tradition: 
a form of human communication wherein knowledge, art, ideas and cultural material is preserved and transmitted orally from one generation to another, through speech or song and may include folktales, ballads, chants, prose or verses.

### Origin story: 
a myth that describes how the world was created, and explains the social order by referring to the sacred forces that established it.

### Pilgrimage: 
a long journey or trial made to some sacred place as an act of religious devotion or spiritual practice

### Mimetic ritual: 
religious practices that are designed to replicate the forces of the wider cosmos on a miniature level (microcosm), and therefore influence or manipulate these forces. i.e.: an altar or shrine
